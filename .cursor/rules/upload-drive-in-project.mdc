# Rules for Upload Drive-In development

Since we are using DDEV in the development environment, we run terminal commands within the DDEV Docker containers.

When we create text in a Blade template, we should always use [messages.php](mdc:resources/lang/en/messages.php) so that the app can be easily translated to other languages. You should always add suggested verbage to the [messages.php](mdc:resources/lang/en/messages.php) file. Indicate the suggested messages by appending the message with * to make it easier to review.

All functions in our PHP code should have comments to document their functionality. Our goal is to make the source code easy for other developers to understand. We prefer readable code.
