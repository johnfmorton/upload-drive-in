# CLI Commands Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for all custom CLI commands available in the Upload Drive-In Laravel application.

## Overview

The application includes several custom Artisan commands for managing file uploads, user administration, database operations, and system maintenance. All commands should be run using the DDEV environment.

### Command Execution Pattern

```bash
ddev artisan [command] [arguments] [options]
```

## File Upload Management Commands

### `uploads:clear-old`

**Purpose**: Clean up old uploaded files from local storage to prevent disk space issues.

**Signature**: `uploads:clear-old {--hours=24}`

**Description**: Removes uploaded files older than the specified number of hours from the `storage/app/public/uploads/` directory.

**Options**:

- `--hours=24` (optional): Number of hours to keep files (default: 24)

**Usage Examples**:

```bash
# Clear files older than 24 hours (default)
ddev artisan uploads:clear-old

# Clear files older than 48 hours
ddev artisan uploads:clear-old --hours=48

# Clear files older than 1 hour
ddev artisan uploads:clear-old --hours=1
```

**Behavior**:

- Logs deleted files to the `uploads_cleanup` log channel
- Provides console output showing which files were deleted
- Returns success/failure status codes
- Validates that hours parameter is positive

---

### `uploads:process-pending`

**Purpose**: Process pending file uploads that failed to upload to Google Drive due to connection issues or other temporary problems.

**Signature**: `uploads:process-pending {--user-id=} {--dry-run} {--limit=50}`

**Description**: Identifies files without a `google_drive_file_id` and re-queues them for Google Drive upload. Includes validation for local file existence and Google Drive connectivity.

**Options**:

- `--user-id=` (optional): Process pending uploads for a specific user ID only
- `--dry-run` (optional): Show what would be processed without actually processing
- `--limit=50` (optional): Maximum number of uploads to process (default: 50)

**Usage Examples**:

```bash
# Process all pending uploads (default limit: 50)
ddev artisan uploads:process-pending

# See what would be processed without actually processing
ddev artisan uploads:process-pending --dry-run

# Process uploads for a specific user
ddev artisan uploads:process-pending --user-id=123

# Process with custom limit
ddev artisan uploads:process-pending --limit=10

# Combine options
ddev artisan uploads:process-pending --user-id=123 --limit=5 --dry-run
```

**Behavior**:

- Queries `file_uploads` table for records missing `google_drive_file_id`
- Validates local files still exist in storage
- Determines appropriate user with Google Drive connection
- Dispatches `UploadToGoogleDrive` job for valid files
- Provides detailed console output with status indicators
- Logs all operations for monitoring

**Output Indicators**:

- ‚úÖ Successfully queued for processing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped (missing connection, file issues)
- ‚ùå Error occurred
- üîç Dry run indicator

**User Priority for Google Drive**:

1. **Uploaded By User**: Employee who uploaded the file
2. **Company User**: Assigned company user for the upload
3. **Admin Fallback**: Any admin user with Google Drive connected

**Use Cases**:

- Recovery after Google Drive connection issues
- Processing uploads after service outages
- Manual intervention during development
- Batch processing of accumulated uploads

**Automatic Processing**: This command also runs automatically every 30 minutes via Laravel scheduler (see [Pending Uploads Documentation](docs/pending-uploads.md) for details).

ddev artisan google-drive:refresh-tokens --force

# Preview what would be refreshed without making changes
ddev artisan google-drive:refresh-tokens --dry-run

# Combine options for testing
ddev artisan google-drive:refresh-tokens --force --dry-run
```

**Behavior**:

- Checks all Google Drive tokens in the database
- Identifies tokens expiring within 24 hours or already expired
- Uses refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens from Google
- Updates token records with new expiration times
- Logs all operations for monitoring and debugging
- Sends email notifications to admin users if refresh fails

**Automatic Scheduling**:

- Runs every 6 hours via Laravel scheduler
- Additional daily run at 9:00 AM as backup
- Prevents manual intervention for token maintenance

**Error Handling**:

- Skips users without refresh tokens (requires re-authentication)
- Logs detailed error information for troubleshooting
- Sends notifications to admin users when failures occur
- Returns appropriate exit codes for monitoring systems

**Monitoring**:

- All operations logged to `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Scheduled runs also logged to `storage/logs/token-refresh.log`
- Email notifications sent to admin users on failures

## Built-in Laravel Commands

### `inspire`

**Purpose**: Display an inspiring quote for developer motivation.

**Signature**: `inspire`

**Usage**:

```bash
ddev artisan inspire
```

## Development Workflow Integration

### Queue Management

Several commands work with the Laravel queue system:

```bash
# Start queue worker for background jobs
ddev artisan queue:work

# View failed jobs
ddev artisan queue:failed

# Retry all failed jobs
ddev artisan queue:retry all

# Clear all jobs from queue
ddev artisan queue:clear
```

### Logging and Monitoring

Monitor command execution with Laravel Pail:

```bash
# Real-time log monitoring
ddev artisan pail

# Filter for specific channels
ddev artisan pail --filter="uploads_cleanup"
```

## Scheduled Commands

The following commands are scheduled to run automatically via Laravel's task scheduler:

### Google Drive Token Refresh

```php
// Defined in app/Console/Kernel.php
$schedule->command('google-drive:refresh-tokens')->everySixHours();
$schedule->command('google-drive:refresh-tokens')->dailyAt('09:00');
```

### Manual Token Refresh

You can also run the token refresh command manually:

```bash
# Refresh tokens that are expiring within 24 hours
ddev artisan google-drive:refresh-tokens

# Force refresh all tokens regardless of expiration
ddev artisan google-drive:refresh-tokens --force

# Dry run to see what would be refreshed without actually doing it
ddev artisan google-drive:refresh-tokens --dry-run
```

## Laravel Scheduler Setup

**Important**: The `schedule()` method in `app/Console/Kernel.php` only **defines** when commands should run. To actually execute scheduled commands, you need to set up a cron job or daemon.

### Development Environment (DDEV)

#### Option 1: DDEV Cron Configuration (Recommended)

Add to your `.ddev/config.yaml`:

```yaml
web_extra_daemons:
  - name: "laravel-scheduler"
    command: "/var/www/html/artisan schedule:work"
    directory: /var/www/html
```

Then restart DDEV:

```bash
ddev restart
```

#### Option 2: Manual Scheduler Commands

```bash
# Run scheduler once (checks what should run now)
ddev artisan schedule:run

# Run scheduler continuously (like a daemon)
ddev artisan schedule:work

# List all scheduled commands
ddev artisan schedule:list
```

### Production Environment

#### Standard Server Setup

Add this single cron job to your server (runs every minute):

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (adjust path to your project)
* * * * * cd /path/to/your/laravel/project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

#### Laravel Forge Setup

Laravel Forge automatically handles scheduler setup:

1. **Automatic Configuration**: Forge automatically adds the required cron job when you deploy a Laravel application
2. **Scheduler Tab**: View and manage scheduled tasks in the Forge dashboard under your site's "Scheduler" tab
3. **Manual Override**: You can disable automatic scheduling and add custom cron jobs if needed

**Forge Cron Job** (automatically added):

```bash
* * * * * /usr/bin/php8.3 /home/forge/your-site.com/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

**Forge Dashboard Features**:

- View scheduled command history
- Enable/disable the scheduler
- Monitor command execution logs
- Set up custom cron jobs if needed

#### Other Hosting Platforms

**Vapor (Serverless)**:

```bash
# Vapor automatically handles scheduling via CloudWatch Events
# No additional configuration needed
```

**Shared Hosting**:

```bash
# Add via cPanel or hosting control panel
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /path/to/your/project/artisan schedule:run
```

### Monitoring Scheduled Commands

#### Check Scheduler Status

```bash
# List all scheduled commands and their next run times
ddev artisan schedule:list

# Test scheduler without waiting
ddev artisan schedule:run

# Run scheduler in foreground (useful for debugging)
ddev artisan schedule:work --verbose
```

#### Logging

Scheduled commands log to multiple locations:

- **Laravel Log**: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- **Custom Log**: `storage/logs/token-refresh.log` (for token refresh)
- **Cron Log**: System cron logs (varies by server)

#### Laravel Forge Monitoring

- **Dashboard**: View command execution history
- **Notifications**: Set up alerts for failed scheduled commands
- **Logs**: Access scheduler logs directly from Forge interface

### Troubleshooting Scheduler Issues

#### Common Problems

1. **Commands not running**: Check if cron job is properly configured
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure web server user can execute artisan
3. **Path issues**: Use absolute paths in cron jobs
4. **Timezone problems**: Set correct timezone in `config/app.php`

#### Debug Commands

```bash
# Verify scheduler configuration
ddev artisan schedule:list

# Run scheduler manually to test
ddev artisan schedule:run --verbose

# Check if specific command works
ddev artisan google-drive:refresh-tokens --dry-run
```

#### Laravel Forge Debugging

- Check "Scheduler" tab for execution history
- Review site logs for scheduler errors
- Verify PHP version matches your application requirements
- Ensure queue workers are running if commands use queues

### Example Scheduling (Available but not currently active)

```php
// Additional commands that could be scheduled
$schedule->command('uploads:clear-old')->daily();
$schedule->command('uploads:process-pending')->everyFiveMinutes();
```

## Error Handling and Return Codes

All custom commands follow Laravel conventions for return codes:

- `0` or `Command::SUCCESS`: Successful execution
- `1` or `Command::FAILURE`: Error occurred
- Commands provide descriptive error messages and logging

## Security Considerations

- **2FA Management**: `admin:2fa-remove` requires careful use as it affects user security
- **Database Operations**: Export/import commands handle sensitive data
- **File Cleanup**: `uploads:clear-old` permanently deletes files
- **User Roles**: Role assignment affects system permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Always use DDEV**: Run commands with `ddev artisan` prefix
2. **Monitor Logs**: Use `ddev artisan pail` to watch command execution
3. **Test First**: Use `--show-only` or dry-run options when available
4. **Backup Data**: Export data before running destructive operations
5. **Queue Workers**: Ensure queue workers are running for upload processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Queue Jobs Not Processing**:

```bash
# Check if queue worker is running
ddev artisan queue:work

# Check for failed jobs
ddev artisan queue:failed
```

**File Upload Issues**:

```bash
# Process pending uploads manually
ddev artisan uploads:process-pending

# Check storage permissions
ddev ssh
ls -la storage/app/public/uploads/
```

**Database Connection Issues**:

```bash
# Test database connection
ddev artisan tinker
>>> DB::connection()->getPdo();
```

**2FA Lockout**:

```bash
# Show 2FA details first
ddev artisan admin:2fa-remove user@example.com --show-only

# Remove if necessary
ddev artisan admin:2fa-remove user@example.com
```
