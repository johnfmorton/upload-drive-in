# Queue Worker JavaScript Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The JavaScript error was occurring because:

1. **Conflicting Method Calls**: The `testQueueWorker()` method was calling `triggerQueueWorkerTest()` which already handled the complete test logic, but then `testQueueWorker()` tried to make its own AJAX request, causing conflicts.

2. **Missing Global Export**: The `SetupStatusManager` class was not exported to the global `window` object, making it unavailable for initialization in the view.

3. **Shoelace Dependencies**: The code was trying to use Shoelace components (`sl-alert`, `sl-icon`, `sl-button`) but the imports were causing issues.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified testQueueWorker Method
**File**: `resources/js/setup-status.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
async testQueueWorker() {
    // Complex implementation with duplicate AJAX calls
    await this.triggerQueueWorkerTest();
    // Then made another AJAX request - CONFLICT!
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
async testQueueWorker() {
    // Simply delegate to the enhanced queue worker test logic
    try {
        await this.triggerQueueWorkerTest();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Queue worker test failed:", error);
    }
}
```

### 2. Fixed Global Export
**File**: `resources/js/setup-status.js`

**Added**:
```javascript
// Export SetupStatusManager to global window object
window.SetupStatusManager = SetupStatusManager;
```

### 3. Removed Problematic Shoelace Dependencies
**File**: `resources/js/setup-status.js`

**Removed**:
```javascript
import '@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/components/alert/alert.js';
import '@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/components/icon/icon.js';
import '@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/components/button/button.js';
```

**Replaced Shoelace toast notifications with simple browser alerts**:
```javascript
showMessage(message, type = "info", showRetryButton = false) {
    console.log(`${type.toUpperCase()}: ${message}`);
    
    if (type === 'error' || showRetryButton) {
        alert(`${type.toUpperCase()}: ${message}`);
        
        if (showRetryButton) {
            const retry = confirm('Would you like to retry now?');
            if (retry) {
                this.retryRefresh();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Added Proper Initialization
**File**: `resources/views/setup/instructions.blade.php`

**Added**:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    console.log('Initializing Setup Status Manager...');
    
    if (typeof window.SetupStatusManager !== 'undefined') {
        window.setupStatusManager = new window.SetupStatusManager();
        console.log('Setup Status Manager initialized successfully');
    } else {
        console.error('SetupStatusManager class not found.');
        // Fallback error handling
    }
});
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Build Assets
```bash
ddev npm run build
```

### 2. Test the Fix
1. Visit the setup instructions page: `https://upload-drive-in.ddev.site/setup/instructions`
2. Open browser developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab
3. You should see:
   ```
   Initializing Setup Status Manager...
   SetupStatusManager: DOM loaded, initializing...
   SetupStatusManager: Instance created
   Setup Status Manager initialized successfully
   ```
4. Click the "Test Queue Worker" button
5. The test should start without JavaScript errors

### 3. Alternative Test Page
A simple test page has been created at `public/test-queue-worker.html` that you can access directly:
- URL: `https://upload-drive-in.ddev.site/test-queue-worker.html`
- This page provides a simplified test environment with console output visible on the page

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **No JavaScript Errors**: The console should not show any JavaScript errors when clicking the "Test Queue Worker" button
2. **Progressive Status Updates**: The status should update from:
   - "Click the Test Queue Worker button below" (initial)
   - "Testing queue worker..." (when clicked)
   - "Test job queued..." (after dispatch)
   - "Queue worker is functioning properly!" (on completion) OR appropriate error message
3. **Button State Management**: Buttons should be properly disabled during testing and re-enabled afterward
4. **Error Handling**: Any errors should be displayed as browser alerts with clear messages

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] "Test Queue Worker" button responds to clicks
- [ ] Status indicator updates appropriately
- [ ] Buttons are disabled during testing
- [ ] Error scenarios show appropriate messages
- [ ] Page refresh preserves status (if cached)
- [ ] "Check Status" button works independently

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist, you can:

1. **Revert to debug version**: Replace the content of `resources/js/setup-status.js` with `resources/js/setup-status-debug.js`
2. **Use simple fallback**: The view now includes fallback error handling if the SetupStatusManager fails to load
3. **Check browser compatibility**: Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Next Steps

1. Test the fix in your browser
2. Verify all functionality works as expected
3. If successful, the debug files can be removed:
   - `resources/js/setup-status-debug.js`
   - `public/test-queue-worker.html`
4. Consider adding proper toast notifications back using a simpler library if needed

The core functionality should now work without JavaScript errors, allowing users to properly test their queue worker setup.
