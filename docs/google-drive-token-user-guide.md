## Automatic Token Renewal

### How It Works

The system automatically manages your Google Drive tokens without requiring manual intervention:

1. **Proactive Renewal**: Tokens are refreshed 15 minutes before they expire
2. **Automatic Retry**: If renewal fails, the system retries with increasing delays
3. **Background Processing**: All renewals happen in the background without interrupting uploads
4. **Failure Recovery**: If automatic renewal fails, you'll be notified to reconnect

### What You'll Experience

#### Normal Operation
- Tokens refresh automatically every ~1 hour
- No interruption to file uploads
- Dashboard shows "Connected" status consistently
- No action required from you

#### Temporary Issues
- Brief "Connection Issues" status during network problems
- Automatic retries resolve most issues within minutes
- File uploads may be delayed but will complete successfully
- System recovers automatically in most cases

#### Manual Intervention Required
- "Authentication Required" status appears
- Email notification sent immediately
- File uploads will fail until reconnection
- One-click reconnection available in dashboard

## Email Notifications
