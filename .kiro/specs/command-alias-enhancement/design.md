# Design Document

## Overview

This enhancement adds command aliases to improve the developer experience by allowing both `user:list` and `users:list` to execute the same functionality. The solution leverages Laravel's built-in command signature alias functionality.

## Architecture

### Current State
- Single command: `ListUsers` class with signature `user:list {--role=} {--owner=}`
- Command registered in `app/Console/Kernel.php`
- Functionality includes filtering by role and owner with table output

### Proposed Changes
- Modify the command signature to include both `user:list` and `users:list` aliases
- No changes needed to the underlying functionality or business logic
- No additional command classes required

## Components and Interfaces

### Modified Components

#### ListUsers Command Class
- **Location**: `app/Console/Commands/ListUsers.php`
- **Change**: Update `$signature` property to include alias
- **Method**: Use Laravel's pipe separator syntax: `user:list|users:list {--role=} {--owner=}`

### Unchanged Components
- Console Kernel registration remains the same
- All existing functionality and options remain identical
- Help system automatically handles aliases through Laravel's built-in functionality

## Data Models

No data model changes required. This is purely a command interface enhancement.

## Error Handling

### Existing Error Handling
- Invalid role validation continues to work for both aliases
- Owner email validation continues to work for both aliases
- Empty result handling remains unchanged

### New Error Scenarios
No new error scenarios introduced. Both aliases will share the same error handling logic.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Verify both command signatures are recognized by the console kernel
- Test that both aliases execute the same underlying functionality
- Validate that command options work identically for both aliases

### Integration Tests
- Test `ddev artisan user:list` continues to work
- Test `ddev artisan users:list` now works
- Test both commands with various option combinations
- Verify help documentation displays correctly for both aliases

### Manual Testing
- Run `ddev artisan list` to confirm both commands appear
- Execute both commands with and without options
- Verify help output with `ddev artisan help user:list` and `ddev artisan help users:list`

## Implementation Notes

### Laravel Command Aliases
Laravel supports multiple command names using the pipe separator in the signature:
```php
protected $signature = 'user:list|users:list {--role=} {--owner=}';
```

This approach:
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Requires no additional code
- Automatically handles help documentation
- Works with all existing options and arguments

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Separate Command Class**: Creating a duplicate command class would introduce code duplication and maintenance overhead.

2. **Console Route Alias**: Using console routes would add unnecessary complexity for this simple use case.

3. **Custom Command Resolution**: Overriding command resolution would be overkill and could introduce unexpected side effects.

The chosen approach using Laravel's built-in alias functionality is the most maintainable and follows framework conventions.
