# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update ListUsers command signature to include alias
  - Modify the `$signature` property in `ListUsers.php` to use pipe separator syntax
  - Change from `user:list {--role=} {--owner=}` to `user:list|users:list {--role=} {--owner=}`
  - Verify the command description remains clear and accurate
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Create unit tests for command alias functionality
  - Write test to verify both `user:list` and `users:list` command signatures are recognized
  - Create test to ensure both aliases execute the same underlying functionality
  - Add test to validate command options work identically for both aliases
  - Test that help documentation is accessible for both command names
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Update command documentation and comments
  - Update the docblock comment in `ListUsers.php` to show both command examples
  - Ensure inline documentation reflects both available command names
  - Update any relevant documentation that references the user list command
  - _Requirements: 2.3_

- [x] 4. Verify integration with existing functionality
  - Test that existing command registration in `Console/Kernel.php` works with aliases
  - Verify that scheduled commands (if any) continue to work
  - Ensure command discovery and listing shows both aliases appropriately
  - _Requirements: 1.3_
