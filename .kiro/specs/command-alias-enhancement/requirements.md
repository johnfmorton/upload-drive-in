# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to provide intuitive command aliases for user management commands. Currently, the `user:list` command exists but users may naturally expect `users:list` to work as well, creating a better developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the application, I want to be able to use both `user:list` and `users:list` commands interchangeably, so that I can use whichever feels more natural without having to remember the exact command name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `ddev artisan users:list` THEN the system SHALL execute the same functionality as `user:list`
2. WHEN I run `ddev artisan user:list` THEN the system SHALL continue to work as it currently does
3. WHEN I run `ddev artisan list` THEN both `user:list` and `users:list` SHALL appear in the available commands list
4. WHEN I use either command with options like `--role=admin` THEN both commands SHALL accept and process the options identically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the help documentation to reflect both command names, so that I understand both aliases are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `ddev artisan help users:list` THEN the system SHALL display the same help information as `user:list`
2. WHEN I run `ddev artisan help user:list` THEN the system SHALL continue to display the current help information
3. WHEN viewing command documentation THEN both command names SHALL be mentioned as available aliases
