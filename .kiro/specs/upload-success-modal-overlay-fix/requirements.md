# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a UI bug where a gray background overlay appears on top of the success modal dialog approximately 1 second after a client uploads a file. The overlay obscures the modal content and creates a poor user experience by making the success message and close button inaccessible or difficult to interact with.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client uploading files, I want the success modal to remain fully visible and interactive after upload completion, so that I can clearly see the confirmation message and easily close the modal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file upload completes successfully THEN the success modal SHALL display without any overlapping gray background
2. WHEN the success modal is displayed THEN all modal content (message, close button) SHALL remain fully visible and interactive
3. WHEN the success modal appears THEN no additional overlays or backgrounds SHALL render on top of the modal content
4. WHEN the success modal is shown THEN the z-index layering SHALL ensure the modal remains the topmost element

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client, I want consistent modal behavior throughout the upload process, so that I have a predictable and professional user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any modal is displayed during the upload process THEN the modal SHALL maintain proper z-index hierarchy
2. WHEN multiple UI elements are present THEN modal dialogs SHALL always appear above other page content
3. WHEN a modal backdrop is used THEN it SHALL not interfere with modal content visibility
4. WHEN the modal is interactive THEN all buttons and controls SHALL remain clickable without obstruction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the modal system to have proper CSS layering and timing controls, so that modal display issues don't occur in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing modal components THEN z-index values SHALL be properly defined and documented
2. WHEN modal animations or delays are used THEN they SHALL not interfere with content visibility
3. WHEN multiple overlays exist THEN their stacking order SHALL be explicitly controlled
4. WHEN modal states change THEN CSS transitions SHALL not create temporary layering conflicts
