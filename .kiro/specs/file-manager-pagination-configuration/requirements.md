# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the file manager pagination system by making the items per page configurable through an environment variable. Currently, the file manager displays 15 items per page by default, but this needs to be adjustable to 10 items per page with the ability to override this value through configuration for real-world testing and optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the number of files displayed per page in the file manager, so that I can optimize the interface for different use cases and performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads the file manager THEN it SHALL use a configurable items per page value instead of the hardcoded 15
2. WHEN no environment variable is set THEN the system SHALL default to 10 items per page
3. WHEN the FILE_MANAGER_ITEMS_PER_PAGE environment variable is set THEN the system SHALL use that value for pagination
4. WHEN an invalid value is provided in the environment variable THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default value of 10

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pagination configuration to be easily discoverable and documented, so that I can quickly adjust it during testing and deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the .env.example file THEN it SHALL contain the FILE_MANAGER_ITEMS_PER_PAGE variable with appropriate documentation
2. WHEN the environment variable is set THEN it SHALL be validated to ensure it's a positive integer
3. WHEN the environment variable exceeds reasonable limits THEN it SHALL be capped at a maximum value to prevent performance issues
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL log the configured pagination value for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the pagination to work consistently across both admin and employee file manager interfaces, so that I have a uniform experience regardless of my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin file manager THEN it SHALL use the configured items per page value
2. WHEN accessing the employee file manager THEN it SHALL use the same configured items per page value
3. WHEN pagination is displayed THEN it SHALL show the correct page numbers based on the configured items per page
4. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the configured items per page SHALL be maintained consistently
