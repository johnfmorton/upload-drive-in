# Requirements Document

## Introduction

After completing the cloud storage provider abstraction enhancement, the Cloud Storage Configuration screen needs validation improvements to ensure proper user experience and functionality. The system should provide clear provider options, default to Google Drive, show appropriate "coming soon" states for unavailable providers, and properly validate Google Drive connections through the Connect button and Dashboard status checks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the Storage Provider Dropdown to default to Google Drive and show clear availability status for other providers, so that I understand which options are currently functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Cloud Storage Configuration screen loads THEN the Storage Provider Dropdown SHALL default to "Google Drive" as the selected option
2. WHEN viewing the dropdown options THEN the system SHALL display "Amazon S3 (coming soon)" as a disabled option
3. WHEN viewing the dropdown options THEN the system SHALL display "OneDrive (coming soon)" as a disabled option
4. WHEN a user attempts to select a "coming soon" option THEN the system SHALL prevent selection and show appropriate feedback
5. IF a user has previously configured a different provider THEN the system SHALL still default to Google Drive but preserve existing configuration data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the Connect button to properly validate my Google Drive connection, so that I can confirm my cloud storage is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Connect" button with Google Drive selected THEN the system SHALL initiate the Google Drive OAuth flow
2. WHEN the OAuth flow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL store the authentication token securely
3. WHEN the OAuth flow fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the failure
4. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL verify the token validity immediately
5. WHEN the token verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the connection status to "Connected"
6. WHEN the token verification fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messaging and connection status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the Dashboard to accurately check and display my Google Drive token status, so that I can monitor my cloud storage connection health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL check the current Google Drive token validity
2. WHEN the token is valid and active THEN the Dashboard SHALL display "Connected" status with a green indicator
3. WHEN the token is expired or invalid THEN the Dashboard SHALL display "Authentication Required" status with appropriate warning indicators
4. WHEN no token exists THEN the Dashboard SHALL display "Not Connected" status with clear call-to-action
5. WHEN token refresh is needed THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic refresh before showing error status
6. WHEN automatic refresh fails THEN the Dashboard SHALL display "Connection Issues" status with guidance for re-authentication
7. WHEN checking token status THEN the system SHALL handle API rate limits gracefully without showing false negative status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want clear visual feedback and error handling throughout the configuration process, so that I can troubleshoot any connection issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration changes are being processed THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
2. WHEN errors occur during configuration THEN the system SHALL display specific, actionable error messages
3. WHEN connection testing is in progress THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
4. WHEN connection testing completes THEN the system SHALL display clear success or failure messaging
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between temporary and permanent failures
6. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the configuration validation to work consistently across different user roles and scenarios, so that all users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses the configuration THEN all validation features SHALL be fully available
2. WHEN an employee user accesses relevant configuration areas THEN appropriate validation SHALL be performed
3. WHEN multiple users configure storage simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations safely
4. WHEN configuration is accessed after system updates THEN existing settings SHALL be preserved and validated
5. WHEN migrating from legacy configuration THEN the validation system SHALL work with both old and new settings
