# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Google Drive connection component's copy-to-clipboard functionality to provide consistent user feedback and follow the established Alpine.js patterns used throughout the application. Currently, the component uses vanilla JavaScript for clipboard operations, which is inconsistent with the Alpine.js approach used in other parts of the app (like the client management system).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user copying upload URLs from the Google Drive connection component, I want consistent visual feedback when the copy operation succeeds, so that I know the URL has been copied to my clipboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the copy button THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback indicating the copy operation was successful
2. WHEN the copy operation completes THEN the button text SHALL change to "Copied!" with green styling
3. WHEN 2 seconds have elapsed after a successful copy THEN the button text SHALL revert to its original state
4. IF the copy operation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without breaking the UI

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the Google Drive connection component to use the same Alpine.js patterns as other components, so that the code is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing clipboard functionality THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js instead of vanilla JavaScript
2. WHEN managing component state THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js data properties for tracking copy status
3. WHEN handling user interactions THEN the system SHALL use Alpine.js event handlers (x-on:click)
4. WHEN the component initializes THEN it SHALL follow the established Alpine.js component structure patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interacting with multiple copy buttons in the interface, I want each button to show independent feedback, so that I can clearly see which specific URL was copied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple copy buttons are present THEN each button SHALL show independent feedback state
2. WHEN one copy button is clicked THEN only that specific button SHALL show the "Copied!" feedback
3. WHEN multiple copy operations happen in quick succession THEN each button SHALL maintain its own feedback timing
4. WHEN a copy button is in the "Copied!" state THEN other copy buttons SHALL remain unaffected

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the copy feedback to be accessible, so that I can use the interface effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the copy state changes THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers
2. WHEN the copy operation succeeds THEN the system SHALL announce the success to assistive technologies
3. WHEN the button state changes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus management
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the copy functionality SHALL work with Enter and Space keys
