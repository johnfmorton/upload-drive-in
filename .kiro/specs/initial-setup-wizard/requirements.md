# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Upload Drive-in needs an initial setup wizard that guides users through the essential configuration steps when the application is first deployed. This wizard ensures that administrators can properly configure the application with their admin credentials and cloud storage provider details before the application becomes fully functional. The setup process should be intuitive, secure, and support both MySQL and SQLite database configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying Upload Drive-in for the first time, I want to be greeted with a setup wizard, so that I can properly configure the application before it becomes available to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed for the first time AND no admin user exists THEN the system SHALL redirect all requests to the setup wizard
2. WHEN the setup wizard is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a welcome message indicating successful installation but requiring initial setup
3. WHEN the setup wizard is active THEN the system SHALL prevent access to all other application routes except the setup process
4. IF the application has already been configured THEN the system SHALL allow normal application access without showing the setup wizard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create the initial admin user account during setup, so that I can access the administrative functions of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup wizard displays the admin user creation step THEN the system SHALL require an email address, password, and password confirmation
2. WHEN the admin user form is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate that the email is in proper format
3. WHEN the admin user form is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate that the password meets security requirements (minimum 8 characters)
4. WHEN the admin user form is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate that password and confirmation match
5. WHEN valid admin user data is provided THEN the system SHALL create the user with admin role and mark them as email verified
6. IF the admin user creation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and allow retry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure cloud storage provider details during setup, so that the application can properly store uploaded files in my preferred cloud service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cloud storage configuration step is displayed THEN the system SHALL show options for supported providers (Google Drive initially)
2. WHEN Google Drive is selected THEN the system SHALL require Google Drive Client ID and Client Secret
3. WHEN cloud storage credentials are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate that required fields are not empty
4. WHEN valid cloud storage credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL store the configuration securely
5. WHEN cloud storage configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL test the connection and display success/failure status
6. IF cloud storage configuration fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and allow reconfiguration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the setup wizard to work with both MySQL and SQLite databases, so that I can deploy the application in different environments based on my infrastructure needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL detect the configured database type from environment variables
2. WHEN using SQLite THEN the system SHALL ensure the database file exists and is writable
3. WHEN using MySQL THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity before proceeding with setup
4. WHEN database connectivity fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN the setup wizard completes THEN the system SHALL work correctly regardless of database type

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the setup wizard to be secure and prevent unauthorized access, so that only legitimate administrators can configure the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup wizard is active THEN the system SHALL only allow access from the server's local network or configured allowed IPs
2. WHEN the setup wizard is completed THEN the system SHALL mark the application as configured and disable the setup routes
3. WHEN someone attempts to access setup routes after configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
4. WHEN the setup wizard stores sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt credentials appropriately
5. WHEN the setup process fails partway through THEN the system SHALL allow resuming from the appropriate step

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear feedback and guidance throughout the setup process, so that I can successfully configure the application even if I'm not familiar with Laravel applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each setup step is displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear instructions and field descriptions
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display specific, actionable error messages
3. WHEN the setup wizard progresses THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator with current step and total steps
4. WHEN the setup wizard completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message and redirect to the admin dashboard
5. WHEN configuration issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance and links to documentation
