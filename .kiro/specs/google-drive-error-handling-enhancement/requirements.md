# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Google Drive integration error handling and user feedback system to provide clear, actionable error messages when Google Drive uploads fail. The current system fails silently or with generic error messages, making it difficult for users to diagnose and resolve issues like expired OAuth tokens, insufficient permissions, or API quota limits.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see specific error messages when Google Drive uploads fail, so that I can quickly identify and resolve the underlying issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Google Drive upload job fails due to token expiration THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating "Google Drive connection expired" with a link to reconnect
2. WHEN a Google Drive upload job fails due to insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating "Insufficient Google Drive permissions" with details about required scopes
3. WHEN a Google Drive upload job fails due to API quota limits THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating "Google Drive API limit reached" with retry timing information
4. WHEN a Google Drive upload job fails due to network connectivity THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating "Network connection issue" and suggest retry
5. WHEN a Google Drive upload job fails for unknown reasons THEN the system SHALL display the actual error message from the Google API response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to be proactively notified when my Google Drive connection has issues, so that I can fix problems before they affect file uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Drive token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL send an email notification to the user
2. WHEN multiple consecutive Google Drive uploads fail THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard alert
3. WHEN Google Drive connection is detected as invalid THEN the system SHALL show a prominent reconnection prompt in the admin interface
4. WHEN Google Drive API returns authentication errors THEN the system SHALL automatically mark the connection as requiring attention

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to easily reconnect my Google Drive account when there are authentication issues, so that I can quickly restore upload functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects Google Drive authentication issues THEN it SHALL provide a one-click reconnection button
2. WHEN a user clicks the reconnection button THEN the system SHALL initiate the OAuth flow while preserving existing settings
3. WHEN reconnection is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically retry any pending failed uploads
4. WHEN reconnection fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error information and troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see the health status of my Google Drive connection in the dashboard, so that I can monitor integration reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display Google Drive connection status (Connected, Expired, Error, Disconnected)
2. WHEN Google Drive connection has issues THEN the status indicator SHALL be prominently displayed with error details
3. WHEN Google Drive connection is healthy THEN the status SHALL show last successful upload timestamp
4. WHEN there are pending uploads waiting for Google Drive connection THEN the dashboard SHALL show the count and provide batch retry options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want detailed logging of Google Drive errors, so that I can troubleshoot complex issues and provide information to support if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Drive API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log the full error response with context
2. WHEN token refresh attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log the outcome and timing
3. WHEN upload jobs fail THEN the system SHALL log the file details, error type, and retry attempts
4. WHEN Google Drive connection status changes THEN the system SHALL log the state transition with timestamp
5. WHEN viewing error logs THEN admin users SHALL be able to filter by Google Drive related errors
