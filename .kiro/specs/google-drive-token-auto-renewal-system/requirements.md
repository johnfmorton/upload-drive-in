# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with Google Drive token management and health status reporting. The current system fails to automatically renew expired tokens and provides inaccurate health status information, leading to failed uploads and misleading dashboard displays. The system must ensure seamless token renewal without manual intervention and provide accurate real-time health status reporting that reflects the actual connection state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want Google Drive tokens to automatically renew without any manual intervention, so that file uploads continue working seamlessly even when tokens expire.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Google Drive access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh it using the stored refresh token before any API operation
2. WHEN token refresh succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the stored tokens and proceed with the original operation without user notification
3. WHEN token refresh fails due to expired refresh token THEN the system SHALL mark the connection as requiring re-authentication and notify the user
4. WHEN token refresh fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL retry the refresh attempt with exponential backoff up to 3 times
5. WHEN multiple concurrent operations require token refresh THEN the system SHALL coordinate refreshes to avoid duplicate refresh attempts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the dashboard health status to accurately reflect the real-time Google Drive connection state, so that I can trust the information displayed and take appropriate action when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard displays "Connected" or "Healthy" status THEN the Google Drive connection SHALL be verified as functional through actual API testing
2. WHEN the dashboard shows healthy status THEN file uploads SHALL succeed without manual intervention
3. WHEN tokens have expired but can be refreshed THEN the system SHALL perform the refresh and maintain "Healthy" status
4. WHEN tokens cannot be refreshed THEN the dashboard SHALL immediately show "Authentication Required" status
5. WHEN the "Test Connection" button is clicked THEN it SHALL perform the same validation as the dashboard status display

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to be immediately notified when Google Drive connection issues occur, so that I can resolve them before they impact file uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token refresh fails permanently THEN the system SHALL send an immediate email notification to the admin user
2. WHEN the dashboard detects connection issues THEN it SHALL display a prominent alert with specific error details
3. WHEN file uploads start failing due to authentication issues THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard status within 1 minute
4. WHEN connection issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically retry any pending failed uploads
5. WHEN multiple authentication failures occur THEN the system SHALL prevent further upload attempts until reconnection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want pending uploads to automatically complete when I reconnect to Google Drive, so that no files are lost due to temporary connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Drive connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically identify and retry all pending uploads
2. WHEN reconnection occurs THEN pending uploads SHALL be processed in the order they were originally queued
3. WHEN retrying pending uploads THEN the system SHALL verify each file still exists locally before attempting upload
4. WHEN pending upload retry succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the file status and notify relevant users
5. WHEN pending upload retry fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and mark the upload as failed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging of token refresh operations and health status changes, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token refresh attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log the attempt, outcome, and timing with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN health status changes THEN the system SHALL log the previous status, new status, and reason for change
3. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the full error response and context
4. WHEN automatic retry operations occur THEN the system SHALL log each attempt with increasing detail for failures
5. WHEN viewing logs THEN developers SHALL be able to filter for token-related events and trace the complete authentication flow

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the system to proactively monitor Google Drive connection health, so that issues are detected and resolved before they impact file uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system has been idle for more than 1 hour THEN it SHALL perform a background health check before processing new uploads
2. WHEN background health checks detect issues THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic remediation before marking the connection as unhealthy
3. WHEN health checks consistently fail THEN the system SHALL escalate to user notification and prevent new upload attempts
4. WHEN health monitoring detects token expiration approaching THEN the system SHALL proactively refresh tokens
5. WHEN health status is queried THEN the response SHALL be based on recent actual connectivity tests, not cached status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want clear visual indicators when Google Drive connection requires my attention, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Drive connection requires re-authentication THEN the dashboard SHALL display a prominent red alert with "Reconnect Required" message
2. WHEN connection issues are temporary THEN the dashboard SHALL show a yellow warning with "Connection Issues - Retrying" message
3. WHEN connection is healthy THEN the dashboard SHALL show a green indicator with "Connected" status and last successful operation timestamp
4. WHEN reconnection is needed THEN the dashboard SHALL provide a one-click "Reconnect to Google Drive" button
5. WHEN reconnection is in progress THEN the dashboard SHALL show a loading state with "Reconnecting..." message

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated recovery mechanisms for common Google Drive connection issues, so that the system maintains high availability without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token refresh fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic with maximum 5 attempts
2. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL automatically delay and retry operations according to Google's rate limit headers
3. WHEN temporary Google API outages occur THEN the system SHALL queue operations and retry when service is restored
4. WHEN connection recovery succeeds THEN the system SHALL automatically process any queued operations
5. WHEN automated recovery fails after all retry attempts THEN the system SHALL escalate to user notification and manual intervention
