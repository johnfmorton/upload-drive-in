# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current cloud storage system has a basic abstraction layer with `CloudStorageProviderInterface` and `CloudStorageErrorHandlerInterface`, but it needs enhancement to be truly generic and extensible for future cloud storage providers like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and others. The system currently has hard-coded dependencies on Google Drive-specific implementations and lacks a proper provider factory pattern for dynamic provider resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Provider Factory and Manager System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized provider factory system so that I can easily add new cloud storage providers without modifying existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to resolve a cloud storage provider THEN it SHALL use a factory pattern to instantiate the correct provider based on configuration
2. WHEN a new provider is added to the configuration THEN the system SHALL automatically make it available without code changes to existing services
3. WHEN multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL support per-user provider selection and fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN provider resolution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to default provider if configured

### Requirement 2: Generic Configuration System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a flexible configuration system so that I can configure different cloud storage providers with their specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a new provider THEN the system SHALL support provider-specific configuration parameters through a generic structure
2. WHEN provider configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate configuration at startup and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL support dynamic reconfiguration without application restart where possible
4. WHEN multiple environments are used THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific provider configurations

### Requirement 3: Provider-Agnostic Service Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want service classes that work with any cloud storage provider so that business logic remains consistent regardless of the underlying storage system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business logic needs cloud storage operations THEN it SHALL use generic interfaces without knowledge of specific providers
2. WHEN switching between providers THEN existing business logic SHALL continue to work without modifications
3. WHEN provider-specific features are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a capability detection mechanism
4. WHEN operations fail THEN error handling SHALL be consistent across all providers

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Provider Interface

**User Story:** As a developer implementing a new cloud storage provider, I want a comprehensive interface that covers all necessary operations so that I can implement full functionality consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a new provider THEN the interface SHALL define all required methods for complete functionality
2. WHEN providers have different capabilities THEN the interface SHALL support capability reporting and feature detection
3. WHEN providers need initialization THEN the interface SHALL support provider-specific setup and configuration validation
4. WHEN providers need cleanup THEN the interface SHALL support proper resource cleanup and connection management

### Requirement 5: Generic Error Handling and Retry Logic

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent error handling across all cloud storage providers so that I can monitor and troubleshoot issues uniformly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in any provider THEN they SHALL be classified using the universal error type system
2. WHEN retry logic is needed THEN it SHALL be configurable per provider and error type
3. WHEN errors require user intervention THEN the system SHALL provide consistent messaging across providers
4. WHEN monitoring errors THEN logs SHALL follow a consistent format regardless of provider

### Requirement 6: Provider Registration and Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automatic provider registration system so that new providers are discovered and registered without manual service container configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new provider class is created THEN it SHALL be automatically discovered and registered if properly configured
2. WHEN providers are registered THEN they SHALL be validated for interface compliance and configuration completeness
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all available providers SHALL be listed in logs for debugging purposes
4. WHEN providers are disabled THEN they SHALL be excluded from registration but remain available for manual instantiation

### Requirement 7: Provider-Specific Feature Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage provider-specific features when available while maintaining compatibility with providers that don't support them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider supports advanced features THEN the system SHALL provide a way to detect and use these features
2. WHEN a provider doesn't support a feature THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade or provide alternative implementations
3. WHEN features have different implementations THEN the system SHALL abstract these differences through the interface
4. WHEN new features are added THEN existing providers SHALL continue to work without requiring immediate updates

### Requirement 8: Configuration Validation and Health Checks

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation of provider configurations so that I can identify and resolve issues before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN all provider configurations SHALL be validated for completeness and correctness
2. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
3. WHEN providers are configured THEN health checks SHALL verify connectivity and permissions
4. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for resolution

### Requirement 9: Migration Path for Existing Google Drive Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the existing Google Drive implementation to the new generic system without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system is implemented THEN existing Google Drive functionality SHALL continue to work without changes
2. WHEN migrating existing code THEN database schema and stored data SHALL remain compatible
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL pass without modification
4. WHEN new providers are added THEN they SHALL coexist with the existing Google Drive implementation

### Requirement 10: Amazon S3 Provider Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system designed with Amazon S3 requirements in mind so that implementing S3 support will be straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the generic system THEN it SHALL accommodate S3's bucket-based storage model
2. WHEN implementing authentication THEN it SHALL support both OAuth (like Google Drive) and API key authentication (like S3)
3. WHEN handling file operations THEN it SHALL support both hierarchical (folder-based) and flat (key-based) storage models
4. WHEN implementing the interface THEN S3-specific concepts like regions, storage classes, and presigned URLs SHALL be accommodated

### Requirement 11: Backward Compatibility and Deprecation Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining existing code, I want a clear deprecation strategy so that I can migrate to the new system at an appropriate pace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system is introduced THEN existing direct usage of GoogleDriveService SHALL continue to work with deprecation warnings
2. WHEN deprecated methods are used THEN clear migration guidance SHALL be provided in logs and documentation
3. WHEN the migration period ends THEN deprecated methods SHALL be removed with appropriate version bumping
4. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration examples

### Requirement 12: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing support for the generic provider system so that I can ensure reliability across all providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing provider tests THEN the system SHALL provide base test classes for common provider functionality
2. WHEN testing multiple providers THEN tests SHALL be able to run against any configured provider
3. WHEN mocking providers THEN the system SHALL provide mock implementations for testing business logic
4. WHEN integration testing THEN the system SHALL support testing against real provider APIs in controlled environments
