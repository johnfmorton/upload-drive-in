# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin user management page currently has a pagination filter issue where the search functionality only filters within the currently displayed page rather than across all records in the database. This creates a poor user experience where users cannot find records that exist on other pages, leading to confusion and inefficient workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to search for users across all pages of results, so that I can find any user regardless of which page they would normally appear on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a search term in the filter input THEN the system SHALL query the database for matching records across all pages
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL display only the matching records with proper pagination
3. WHEN I clear the search filter THEN the system SHALL return to the normal paginated view of all users
4. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no results found" message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the search to work with the existing primary contact filter, so that I can search within filtered results effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have the primary contact filter active AND I enter a search term THEN the system SHALL search only within primary contact users
2. WHEN I have a search term active AND I toggle the primary contact filter THEN the system SHALL maintain the search term while applying the filter
3. WHEN both filters are active THEN the URL SHALL reflect both the search term and the primary contact filter state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the search to be performant and responsive, so that I can quickly find the users I'm looking for without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the search input THEN the system SHALL debounce the search to avoid excessive database queries
2. WHEN search results are loading THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to indicate the search is in progress
3. WHEN the search completes THEN the system SHALL update the results within 2 seconds for typical datasets
4. WHEN I navigate between search result pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the search term and filter state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the search functionality to work consistently across desktop and mobile views, so that I have the same experience regardless of device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search on desktop table view THEN the search SHALL work across all database records
2. WHEN I search on mobile card view THEN the search SHALL work across all database records  
3. WHEN I switch between desktop and mobile views THEN the search state SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN both desktop and mobile views SHALL show the same filtered data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the search to work intuitively with partial matches, so that I can find users even if I don't remember their exact name or email.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for a partial name THEN the system SHALL return users whose names contain the search term
2. WHEN I search for a partial email THEN the system SHALL return users whose emails contain the search term
3. WHEN I search with mixed case THEN the system SHALL perform case-insensitive matching
4. WHEN I search for multiple words THEN the system SHALL return users that match any of the words in name or email fields
