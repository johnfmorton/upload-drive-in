  - Update pagination links to include current search term and filter parameters
  - Ensure pagination works correctly when search results span multiple pages
  - Test that navigating between pages maintains search and filter state
  - Verify that clearing search returns to normal paginated view

- [x] 5. Add loading states and user feedback for search operations ✅ COMPLETED
  - Implement visual loading indicator during search form submission
  - Add debounce timing to prevent excessive server requests while typing
  - Ensure search completes within performance requirements
  - Add proper error handling for search failures
  - Display appropriate messages for empty search results
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Update Alpine.js component to remove client-side filtering ✅ COMPLETED
  - Remove `filterQuery`, `filteredAndSortedClients`, and related filtering methods
  - Keep existing modal management, copy URL functionality, and column visibility controls
  - Simplify Alpine.js data structure to focus on UI interactions only
  - Add search form submission handling to Alpine.js component
  - Ensure all existing functionality (delete modals, copy buttons) continues to work
  - _Requirements: 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive test coverage for search functionality
  - Write unit tests for controller search logic with various search terms
  - Test combination of search with primary contact filter
  - Test pagination behavior with search parameters
  - Test empty search results and error handling
  - Write integration tests for complete search workflow
  - Test mobile and desktop view consistency with search results
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Add database performance optimizations for search
  - Verify existing indexes on users.name and users.email fields
  - Add database indexes if needed for optimal search performance
  - Test search performance with larger datasets
  - Implement query optimization for combined search and filter operations
  - Add monitoring for search query performance
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Core Functionality ✅

The main pagination filter enhancement has been successfully implemented:

1. **Server-side Search**: AdminUserController now handles search queries across all database records
2. **Form-based Search**: Replaced Alpine.js client-side filtering with proper HTML form submission
3. **Debounced Input**: Added 500ms debounce to prevent excessive server requests
4. **State Preservation**: Search terms and filters are preserved in URLs and across pagination
5. **Responsive Design**: Both mobile and desktop views now use server-side data consistently
6. **Simplified Alpine.js**: Removed client-side filtering logic while keeping UI interactions
7. **Translation Support**: Added missing translation key for search results

### Key Changes Made

- **Controller**: Added search validation, database query logic, and parameter preservation
- **View Template**: Replaced Alpine.js filtering with server-side data iteration
- **Search Form**: Implemented debounced form submission with proper state management
- **Empty States**: Added appropriate messages for no search results vs no users
- **Pagination**: Automatically preserves search and filter parameters in URLs

### Testing Needed

The remaining tasks (7 and 8) focus on testing and performance optimization, which should be completed to ensure production readiness.
