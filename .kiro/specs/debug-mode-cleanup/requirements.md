# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up development-only debug functionality from the file manager preview modal. The debug mode toggle button and its associated JavaScript functions were added during the debugging process for modal overlay issues and are no longer needed in the codebase. This cleanup will remove temporary debugging code while preserving all production functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove temporary debug code from the file manager preview modal, so that the codebase remains clean and production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the file manager preview modal THEN the debug mode toggle button SHALL NOT be visible
2. WHEN inspecting the preview modal template THEN no debug-related HTML elements SHALL be present
3. WHEN reviewing the JavaScript code THEN no debug mode functions SHALL remain
4. WHEN testing the preview modal functionality THEN all core features SHALL continue to work normally

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that removing debug code doesn't break existing functionality, so that the file manager continues to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening a file preview modal THEN the modal SHALL display correctly with proper z-index layering
2. WHEN closing a file preview modal THEN the modal SHALL close properly without overlay issues
3. WHEN switching between different file previews THEN the modal content SHALL update correctly
4. WHEN testing modal interactions THEN all buttons and controls SHALL function as intended

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove any debug-related CSS and JavaScript files that are no longer needed, so that the application doesn't load unnecessary resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing CSS files THEN any debug-specific styles SHALL be removed if no longer needed
2. WHEN reviewing JavaScript files THEN any debug-specific functions SHALL be removed
3. WHEN loading the file manager page THEN no debug-related assets SHALL be loaded
4. WHEN inspecting the browser console THEN no debug-related console logs SHALL appear
