# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The employee file manager currently has a critical issue where preview and download functionality redirects users directly to Google Drive URLs instead of serving files through the application. This bypasses security controls, audit logging, and proper access management. The admin file manager works correctly by serving files through the application's services, but the employee controller uses direct Google Drive redirects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an employee user, I want to preview and download files through the application's secure endpoints, so that my file access is properly logged and secured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee clicks the preview button THEN the system SHALL serve the file preview through the application's preview service instead of redirecting to Google Drive
2. WHEN an employee clicks the download button THEN the system SHALL serve the file download through the application's download service instead of redirecting to Google Drive
3. WHEN an employee accesses a file THEN the system SHALL log the access through the audit service
4. WHEN an employee accesses a file THEN the system SHALL validate security permissions through the file security service

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent file access behavior between admin and employee interfaces, so that security policies are uniformly enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing admin and employee file access THEN both SHALL use the same underlying file services
2. WHEN a file access occurs THEN the system SHALL apply the same security validations regardless of user type
3. WHEN a file is accessed THEN the system SHALL generate consistent audit logs regardless of user type
4. WHEN a file preview fails THEN the system SHALL return consistent error responses regardless of user type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want all file access to be logged and monitored, so that I can track file usage across all user types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee previews a file THEN the system SHALL log the preview access with user, file, and timestamp information
2. WHEN an employee downloads a file THEN the system SHALL log the download access with user, file, and timestamp information
3. WHEN file access is denied THEN the system SHALL log the security violation with appropriate context
4. WHEN unsafe file types are accessed THEN the system SHALL block access and log the security event

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an employee user, I want file previews and downloads to work reliably without external dependencies, so that I can access files even when Google Drive has connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Drive is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL still attempt to serve cached or local file content where possible
2. WHEN a file preview fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message instead of a broken redirect
3. WHEN a file download fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error feedback to the user
4. WHEN file access errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
