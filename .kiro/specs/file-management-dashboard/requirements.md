# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the admin dashboard's file management interface to address current usability issues and provide a more efficient file management experience. The current implementation has separate mobile and desktop views with limited functionality for bulk operations, layout issues with long filenames, and dependency on external Google Drive access for file viewing and downloading.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to select multiple files and delete them in a batch operation, so that I can efficiently manage large numbers of uploaded files without having to delete them one by one.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the file list THEN the system SHALL display a checkbox for each file row
2. WHEN I click the "Select All" checkbox THEN the system SHALL select all visible files in the current filtered view
3. WHEN I select individual file checkboxes THEN the system SHALL update a counter showing how many files are selected
4. WHEN I have files selected THEN the system SHALL display a "Delete Selected" button
5. WHEN I click "Delete Selected" THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with the count of files to be deleted
6. WHEN I confirm the batch deletion THEN the system SHALL delete all selected files and remove them from both local storage and Google Drive
7. WHEN the batch deletion is complete THEN the system SHALL show a success message and refresh the file list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want a unified responsive file list that works well on both mobile and desktop devices, so that I don't have to maintain separate views and can ensure consistent functionality across all screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the file list on any device THEN the system SHALL display a single responsive interface that adapts to screen size
2. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL use a card-based layout with proper text wrapping
3. WHEN viewing on desktop devices THEN the system SHALL use a table layout with flexible column widths
4. WHEN long filenames are displayed THEN the system SHALL wrap text properly without causing horizontal overflow
5. WHEN the table would overflow horizontally THEN the system SHALL maintain visibility of all essential columns through responsive design
6. WHEN switching between device orientations THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality and readability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, employee, or client, I want to preview uploaded files directly within the application, so that I can view file contents without needing access to the Google Drive account or external applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a "Preview" button on a file THEN the system SHALL display the file content in a modal or dedicated view
2. WHEN previewing image files THEN the system SHALL display the image with zoom and pan capabilities
3. WHEN previewing PDF files THEN the system SHALL display the PDF with page navigation controls
4. WHEN previewing text files THEN the system SHALL display the content with syntax highlighting if applicable
5. WHEN previewing unsupported file types THEN the system SHALL show file metadata and offer download option
6. WHEN the file is not yet uploaded to Google Drive THEN the system SHALL preview from local storage
7. WHEN the file is stored in Google Drive THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the content using stored credentials

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, employee, or client, I want to download files directly from the application, so that I can access uploaded files without requiring Google Drive account access or external authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a "Download" button on a file THEN the system SHALL initiate a direct file download
2. WHEN downloading a file stored locally THEN the system SHALL serve the file directly from application storage
3. WHEN downloading a file stored in Google Drive THEN the system SHALL fetch the file using stored credentials and serve it to the user
4. WHEN downloading multiple selected files THEN the system SHALL create a ZIP archive containing all selected files
5. WHEN the download is initiated THEN the system SHALL show download progress for large files
6. WHEN a download fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and retry option
7. WHEN downloading files as a non-admin user THEN the system SHALL respect user permissions and only allow access to authorized files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin, I want improved table layout management with better column control, so that I can customize the view to show the most relevant information without layout issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the file table THEN the system SHALL use flexible column widths that prevent overflow
2. WHEN I toggle column visibility THEN the system SHALL remember my preferences across sessions
3. WHEN columns are hidden THEN the system SHALL redistribute available space among visible columns
4. WHEN the filename column contains long text THEN the system SHALL wrap text while maintaining table structure
5. WHEN sorting by any column THEN the system SHALL maintain the current column visibility settings
6. WHEN filtering files THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive layout regardless of content length
7. WHEN resizing the browser window THEN the system SHALL adapt column widths appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with any role, I want consistent file access controls, so that I can only view and download files that I have permission to access based on my role and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am an admin THEN the system SHALL allow me to view, preview, and download all files
2. WHEN I am an employee THEN the system SHALL allow me to access files from clients I manage
3. WHEN I am a client THEN the system SHALL allow me to access only files I have uploaded
4. WHEN attempting to access unauthorized files THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN file permissions change THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the updated access rights
6. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL log the download activity for audit purposes
7. WHEN previewing files THEN the system SHALL apply the same permission checks as downloading
