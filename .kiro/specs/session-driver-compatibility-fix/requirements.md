# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently fails when `SESSION_DRIVER=database` is configured in production due to a missing `secureFileWrite` method in the `SetupSecurityService` class. This method is called during setup state persistence but is not implemented, causing an "Internal Server Error" with the message "Call to undefined method App\Services\SetupSecurityService::secureFileWrite()". The application works correctly with `SESSION_DRIVER=file` in the local DDEV environment, but production requires database sessions for scalability and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to work with database sessions so that I can deploy it in a production environment with proper session management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is configured with `SESSION_DRIVER=database` THEN the application SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN setup state needs to be persisted THEN the system SHALL successfully save the state using secure file operations
3. WHEN the `SetupSecurityService::secureFileWrite` method is called THEN it SHALL write files securely with proper validation and error handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `SetupSecurityService` to have complete file operation methods so that setup operations work consistently across different session drivers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `SetupSecurityService` class is instantiated THEN it SHALL have both `secureFileRead` and `secureFileWrite` methods available
2. WHEN `secureFileWrite` is called with valid parameters THEN it SHALL validate the file path for security concerns
3. WHEN `secureFileWrite` encounters an error THEN it SHALL return a structured error response with success status and message
4. WHEN `secureFileWrite` succeeds THEN it SHALL return a success response with confirmation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want file write operations to be secure and validated so that the application prevents path traversal and other file system attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `secureFileWrite` receives a file path THEN it SHALL validate the path against directory traversal attempts
2. WHEN `secureFileWrite` detects suspicious file paths THEN it SHALL reject the operation and log the security event
3. WHEN `secureFileWrite` is called THEN it SHALL only allow writing to authorized directories within the storage path
4. WHEN file permissions are specified THEN the system SHALL apply them securely using the provided mode parameter

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want session configuration to be flexible so that I can choose the appropriate session driver for my deployment environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts with `SESSION_DRIVER=file` THEN it SHALL work correctly as it currently does
2. WHEN the application starts with `SESSION_DRIVER=database` THEN it SHALL work correctly without throwing undefined method errors
3. WHEN the sessions table exists in the database THEN the application SHALL use it for session storage
4. WHEN switching between session drivers THEN the application SHALL maintain functionality without code changes
