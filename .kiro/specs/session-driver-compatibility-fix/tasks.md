# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement secureFileWrite method in SetupSecurityService
  - Add the missing `secureFileWrite` method with the same signature as called by SetupService
  - Implement path validation using existing `validateFilePath` method
  - Add directory creation logic for parent directories
  - Implement atomic file writing using temporary files
  - Add file permission setting with the provided mode parameter
  - Include comprehensive error handling and structured return format
  - Integrate with existing `logSecurityEvent` method for security monitoring
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 2. Add unit tests for secureFileWrite method
  - Create test cases for successful file writing operations
  - Test path validation with malicious paths (directory traversal, null bytes)
  - Test error handling for permission issues and I/O failures
  - Test file mode setting and verification
  - Test atomic write operations and cleanup on failure
  - Verify security event logging for both success and failure cases
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 3. Update existing integration tests for database session compatibility
  - Modify SetupService integration tests to work with database sessions
  - Add test cases that specifically test setup state saving with database sessions
  - Update mocking in existing tests to include the new secureFileWrite method
  - Verify that setup process works end-to-end with both session drivers
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 4. Add feature tests for session driver compatibility
  - Create test that verifies application startup with SESSION_DRIVER=database
  - Test complete setup wizard flow with database sessions
  - Test session persistence and retrieval with database driver
  - Verify that switching between session drivers doesn't break functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Verify and document session table requirements
  - Confirm that sessions table migration exists and is properly structured
  - Test that database sessions work correctly with the existing sessions table
  - Document any additional database requirements for production deployment
  - Verify session cleanup and garbage collection works with database driver
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_
