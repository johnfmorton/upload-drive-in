# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has a critical issue where file uploads can become stuck in a "Pending" state indefinitely, even when queue processing commands are executed. This creates a poor user experience and potential data loss. Additionally, the current "Process 1 Pending" button uses basic alerts instead of following the established modal development standards. This feature will implement a comprehensive pending upload recovery system with proper modal interfaces and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want a reliable system to automatically detect and recover stuck pending uploads, so that no uploads are lost due to queue processing failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects uploads that have been pending for more than 30 minutes THEN it SHALL automatically attempt to reprocess them
2. WHEN an upload fails to process after 3 automatic retry attempts THEN it SHALL be marked as "Failed" with detailed error information
3. WHEN the system processes pending uploads THEN it SHALL log all actions for debugging and audit purposes
4. WHEN an upload is successfully recovered THEN it SHALL update the status to "Uploaded" and notify relevant parties
5. IF an upload cannot be processed due to missing files THEN it SHALL be marked as "Missing File" with appropriate error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want a dashboard interface that follows modal development standards to manually process pending uploads, so that I can intervene when automatic recovery fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Process Pending Uploads" THEN it SHALL open a modal following the established z-index hierarchy and design standards
2. WHEN the modal opens THEN it SHALL display the count of pending uploads and processing options
3. WHEN I confirm processing THEN it SHALL show a loading state with progress indicators
4. WHEN processing completes THEN it SHALL display results summary and close automatically on success
5. IF processing fails THEN it SHALL keep the modal open and display specific error messages
6. WHEN I cancel the operation THEN it SHALL close the modal without processing any uploads

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want detailed visibility into why uploads are failing, so that I can identify and resolve systemic issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upload fails THEN it SHALL record the specific error message, timestamp, and retry count
2. WHEN I view the file manager THEN it SHALL display clear status indicators for Failed, Pending, and Missing File states
3. WHEN I click on a failed upload THEN it SHALL show detailed error information in a modal
4. WHEN the system encounters repeated failures THEN it SHALL log patterns for administrative review
5. IF Google Drive API limits are exceeded THEN it SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want automated monitoring and alerting for upload processing issues, so that I can proactively address problems before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploads remain pending for more than 1 hour THEN it SHALL send an alert notification
2. WHEN the failure rate exceeds 10% over a 24-hour period THEN it SHALL trigger an administrative alert
3. WHEN Google Drive tokens expire or become invalid THEN it SHALL notify the admin immediately
4. WHEN disk space is low and affecting uploads THEN it SHALL alert before reaching critical levels
5. IF the queue worker stops responding THEN it SHALL detect and alert within 15 minutes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive CLI tools for diagnosing and fixing upload issues, so that I can resolve problems efficiently in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the diagnosis command THEN it SHALL check queue worker status, disk space, API connectivity, and token validity
2. WHEN I run the recovery command THEN it SHALL process all pending uploads with detailed progress reporting
3. WHEN I run the cleanup command THEN it SHALL remove orphaned files and update inconsistent database states
4. WHEN I run the health check THEN it SHALL verify all system components and report any issues
5. IF I specify specific upload IDs THEN it SHALL allow targeted processing and debugging of individual uploads
