# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current cloud storage status display shows redundant and confusing information to users. The health status section displays generic "Connection issues detected - please check your network and try again" messages that don't provide actionable information, while the system already has better, more specific error messages like "Too many token refresh attempts. Please try again later." This feature will clean up the status messaging to provide clear, actionable, and non-redundant information to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing cloud storage status, I want to see clear and specific error messages, so that I understand exactly what the issue is and what action I need to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cloud storage connection has issues THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages instead of generic "connection issues" text
2. WHEN a token refresh limit is reached THEN the system SHALL display "Too many token refresh attempts. Please try again later." instead of generic connection messages
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL display "Authentication required. Please reconnect your account." instead of generic messages
4. WHEN the system detects specific error types THEN it SHALL map them to user-friendly, actionable messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing cloud storage status, I want to avoid seeing redundant information, so that the interface is clean and easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying cloud storage status THEN the system SHALL show only one primary status message per issue
2. WHEN multiple status indicators exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single, clear message
3. WHEN the connection status badge shows "Connected" THEN the health status SHALL NOT contradict this with "Connection issues"
4. WHEN status information is redundant THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing cloud storage status, I want the status display to be consistent across different parts of the application, so that I get the same information regardless of where I view it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing status in the dashboard THEN the messaging SHALL be consistent with modal error messages
2. WHEN the same error occurs in different contexts THEN the system SHALL display the same user-friendly message
3. WHEN status changes THEN all status displays SHALL update consistently
4. WHEN error messages are updated THEN they SHALL be centralized to ensure consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user experiencing cloud storage issues, I want actionable guidance on how to resolve problems, so that I can fix issues myself without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a clear "Reconnect" or "Authenticate" action
2. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL indicate when the user can try again
3. WHEN network issues are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest specific troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN the error is temporary THEN the system SHALL indicate this and suggest waiting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want centralized error message management, so that I can easily update and maintain consistent messaging across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error messages need to be updated THEN they SHALL be managed in a central location
2. WHEN new error types are added THEN they SHALL follow the established messaging patterns
3. WHEN debugging status issues THEN the system SHALL log detailed information while showing simplified messages to users
4. WHEN error mapping occurs THEN it SHALL be easily configurable and maintainable
