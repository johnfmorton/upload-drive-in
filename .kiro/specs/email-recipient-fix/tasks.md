# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix recipient selection logic in SendBatchUploadNotifications listener
  - Update the recipient determination logic to properly distinguish between client and employee uploads
  - Replace the problematic fallback logic with context-aware recipient selection
  - Add proper handling for edge cases where recipients are invalid or missing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Enhance logging throughout the notification system
  - Add detailed logging for recipient selection process showing upload context and selected recipients
  - Improve error logging with more specific messages for different failure scenarios
  - Add success logging to confirm correct recipient targeting
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Improve error handling for notification failures
  - Implement graceful handling of missing or invalid recipient data
  - Ensure processing continues for other uploads even if one fails
  - Add proper fallback logic when no valid recipient can be determined
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Create unit tests for recipient selection logic
  - Write tests for client upload scenarios with specific recipients selected
  - Write tests for employee upload scenarios where uploader should be notified
  - Write tests for fallback scenarios with invalid or missing recipients
  - Write tests for batch uploads with mixed recipient types
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Create integration tests for complete email notification flow
  - Test end-to-end email delivery for client uploads to specific recipients
  - Test employee upload notifications go to correct uploader
  - Test client confirmation emails are sent regardless of recipient
  - Test batch upload scenarios with multiple recipients
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 6. Add helper methods to improve code organization
  - Create helper methods for determining upload context (client vs employee upload)
  - Create helper methods for recipient selection with proper fallback logic
  - Create helper methods for logging recipient selection decisions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4_
