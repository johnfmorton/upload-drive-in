# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current email notification system for file uploads has a critical bug where admin users receive all upload notifications instead of the intended recipient (employee or admin user) selected by the client during upload. This issue affects the core functionality of the file intake system, where clients should be able to send files to specific employees or admin users and those recipients should receive the appropriate notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client user, I want my uploaded files to trigger email notifications to the specific employee or admin user I selected as the recipient, so that the correct person is notified about my upload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client uploads files and selects a specific employee or admin user as the recipient THEN the notification email SHALL be sent to that selected recipient only
2. WHEN a client uploads files without selecting a specific recipient THEN the notification email SHALL be sent to their primary company user (employee or admin)
3. WHEN a client uploads files and no valid recipient can be determined THEN the notification email SHALL be sent to the admin user as a fallback
4. WHEN multiple files are uploaded in a batch to different recipients THEN each recipient SHALL receive a notification containing only the files intended for them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an employee or admin user, I want to receive email notifications only for files that were specifically uploaded for me, so that I don't get overwhelmed with irrelevant notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client uploads files intended for me THEN I SHALL receive an email notification containing details of those files
2. WHEN a client uploads files intended for another employee or admin user THEN I SHALL NOT receive a notification for those files
3. WHEN I am the admin user and no specific recipient is selected THEN I SHALL receive the notification as the fallback recipient
4. WHEN files are uploaded by an employee or admin user on behalf of a client THEN the notification SHALL be sent to the uploader (employee/admin user)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client user, I want to continue receiving confirmation emails for my uploads regardless of who the intended recipient is, so that I have proof of successful submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload files THEN I SHALL always receive a confirmation email listing all files I uploaded
2. WHEN I upload files to multiple recipients THEN my confirmation email SHALL show the names of all intended recipients
3. WHEN I have disabled upload notifications in my settings THEN I SHALL NOT receive confirmation emails
4. IF my confirmation email fails to send THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue processing recipient notifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the email notification system to have proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure reliable delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system determines recipients for notifications THEN it SHALL log the recipient selection logic and results
2. WHEN an email fails to send to a recipient THEN the system SHALL log the error with relevant context
3. WHEN no valid recipient can be determined for an upload THEN the system SHALL log a warning and use the admin fallback
4. WHEN the recipient selection logic encounters invalid data THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and continue processing other uploads
