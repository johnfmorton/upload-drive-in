# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has separate file manager templates for admin and employee users, leading to code duplication and inconsistent user experiences. The admin file manager has received significant improvements including enhanced modals, better error handling, advanced filtering, and improved UI components, while the employee file manager lacks these features. This consolidation will create a unified, DRY template system that provides consistent functionality across both user types while maintaining appropriate access controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate file manager templates into reusable components, so that I can maintain consistent functionality and reduce code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing file manager templates THEN both admin and employee views SHALL use the same base components
2. WHEN making updates to file manager functionality THEN changes SHALL automatically apply to both user types
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be no duplicate file manager template code between admin and employee views
4. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL accept user-type parameters to handle route differences
5. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL maintain existing functionality for both admin and employee users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the employee file manager to have the same advanced features as the admin version, so that all users have a consistent and powerful file management experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee accesses the file manager THEN they SHALL see the same UI improvements as the admin version
2. WHEN an employee uses file manager features THEN they SHALL have access to advanced filtering, column management, and bulk operations
3. WHEN an employee interacts with modals THEN they SHALL have the same enhanced modal experience with proper z-index handling
4. WHEN an employee encounters errors THEN they SHALL see the same improved error handling and notifications
5. WHEN an employee uses the file manager THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and accessible like the admin version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper access control maintained during template consolidation, so that users only access files and operations appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components generate routes THEN they SHALL use the correct route patterns for each user type
2. WHEN employees access file operations THEN they SHALL only see files they have permission to access
3. WHEN admin users access file operations THEN they SHALL maintain their existing broader access permissions
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use the appropriate endpoints based on user type
5. WHEN file operations are performed THEN proper authorization SHALL be enforced at the backend level

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create comprehensive shared components for file manager functionality, so that all file manager features are consistently implemented across user types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating file manager components THEN there SHALL be components for header, toolbar, filters, file grid, file table, and modals
2. WHEN components are implemented THEN they SHALL accept props for user-type-specific customization
3. WHEN JavaScript functionality is shared THEN it SHALL be parameterized for different user types and routes
4. WHEN modal components are created THEN they SHALL include the enhanced z-index handling and debugging features
5. WHEN components are tested THEN they SHALL work correctly for both admin and employee user types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user (admin or employee), I want consistent file preview and management capabilities, so that I have the same powerful tools regardless of my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN previewing files THEN both user types SHALL use the same enhanced preview modal with proper overlay handling
2. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN both user types SHALL have access to bulk delete and download functionality
3. WHEN filtering files THEN both user types SHALL have access to advanced filtering options including date ranges and file types
4. WHEN managing table columns THEN both user types SHALL be able to show/hide columns and customize their view
5. WHEN switching between grid and table views THEN both user types SHALL have the same view mode toggle functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility during the consolidation, so that existing functionality continues to work without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are consolidated THEN existing routes SHALL continue to function correctly
2. WHEN JavaScript is refactored THEN existing Alpine.js data structures SHALL remain compatible
3. WHEN components are created THEN existing CSS classes and styling SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
5. WHEN users access the file manager THEN there SHALL be no breaking changes to the user experience
