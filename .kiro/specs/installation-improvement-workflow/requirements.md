# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the poor initial installation experience where new users encounter a 500 error due to missing Vite manifest files. The system should gracefully guide users through the complete setup process with clear instructions and user-friendly interfaces, from asset compilation through database configuration to admin user creation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user installing the application, I want to see helpful setup instructions instead of a 500 error, so that I can successfully complete the installation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed AND the Vite manifest file is missing THEN the system SHALL display a setup screen with clear instructions for running npm commands
2. WHEN the setup screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step instructions including "npm ci" and "npm run build" commands
3. WHEN the setup screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a way to check if the build step has been completed successfully
4. IF the Vite manifest exists THEN the system SHALL proceed to the next setup step instead of showing build instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user who has completed the asset build, I want to be guided through database configuration, so that I can set up my database connection without manually editing .env files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vite manifest exists AND database connection fails THEN the system SHALL display a database configuration form
2. WHEN the database configuration form is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide fields for database host, port, name, username, and password
3. WHEN database credentials are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate the connection before saving
4. WHEN database credentials are valid THEN the system SHALL update the .env file with the provided values
5. WHEN database credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting hints
6. IF database connection is successful THEN the system SHALL proceed to the next setup step

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new user with a working database connection, I want to be prompted to create the initial admin user, so that I can access the application's admin features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connection is established AND no admin users exist THEN the system SHALL display an admin user creation form
2. WHEN the admin user creation form is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide fields for name, email, and password
3. WHEN admin user details are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate the input according to application rules
4. WHEN admin user creation is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect to the admin dashboard
5. WHEN admin user creation fails THEN the system SHALL display validation errors with clear guidance
6. IF an admin user already exists THEN the system SHALL redirect to the normal login flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new user going through setup, I want the setup process to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand and resolve any issues that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any setup step encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN file system operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide guidance about file permissions and directory access
3. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting steps for connectivity issues
4. WHEN the setup process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL allow resuming from the appropriate step
5. WHEN setup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and next steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want the setup process to be secure and not expose sensitive information, so that the installation remains secure even during initial setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying setup screens THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive configuration details
2. WHEN handling .env file updates THEN the system SHALL preserve existing non-database configuration
3. WHEN database credentials are entered THEN the system SHALL not log or display passwords in plain text
4. WHEN setup is complete THEN the system SHALL disable or secure the setup endpoints
5. WHEN setup screens are accessed after completion THEN the system SHALL redirect to the normal application flow

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear visual feedback during the setup process, so that I understand what steps are complete and what needs to be done next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setup screens are displayed THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator with current step
2. WHEN each setup step is completed THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of success
3. WHEN moving between setup steps THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the transition
4. WHEN setup is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent access to normal application features
5. WHEN all setup steps are complete THEN the system SHALL provide a clear completion message and next steps
