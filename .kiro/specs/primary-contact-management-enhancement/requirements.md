# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current primary contact system is functional but lacks clear user interface elements and management capabilities. Users can see who is marked as "Primary Contact" in the client details view, but the significance and management of this designation needs improvement. The primary contact serves as the default recipient for file uploads and notifications when no specific recipient is selected, making it a critical business function that deserves better user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin or employee, I want to clearly understand what "Primary Contact" means and its impact on file handling, so that I can make informed decisions about client management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a client's team access page THEN the system SHALL display a clear explanation of what "Primary Contact" designation means
2. WHEN viewing a client's team access page THEN the system SHALL show the current primary contact with enhanced visual prominence
3. WHEN viewing the primary contact designation THEN the system SHALL include tooltip or help text explaining the behavioral impact

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin or employee, I want to easily change which team member is the primary contact for a client, so that I can ensure files and notifications go to the right person.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a client's team access page THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to change the primary contact designation
2. WHEN changing the primary contact THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog explaining the impact of the change
3. WHEN the primary contact is changed THEN the system SHALL update the database and show success feedback
4. WHEN attempting to remove the primary contact designation from the last remaining team member THEN the system SHALL prevent this action and show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin or employee, I want to see which clients I am the primary contact for, so that I can understand my responsibilities and workload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing my dashboard THEN the system SHALL show a count of clients where I am the primary contact
2. WHEN viewing the client relationships section THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which clients I am the primary contact for
3. WHEN viewing client lists THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options to show only clients where I am the primary contact

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to ensure every client has a primary contact assigned, so that file uploads and notifications always have a clear destination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new client relationship THEN the system SHALL automatically assign the creating user as the primary contact
2. WHEN adding additional team members to a client THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing primary contact unless explicitly changed
3. WHEN removing a team member who is the primary contact THEN the system SHALL either prevent the removal or require assignment of a new primary contact
4. WHEN viewing client management pages THEN the system SHALL highlight any clients without a primary contact (if such a state is possible)
