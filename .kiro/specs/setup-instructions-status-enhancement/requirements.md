# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the setup instructions page by adding real-time status indicators for each setup step. Currently, the setup instructions display all steps as incomplete, requiring administrators to manually track their progress. This enhancement will leverage the existing SetupDetectionService to show "Completed", "Incomplete", or other appropriate status indicators next to each setup step, providing immediate feedback on configuration progress.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator setting up the application, I want to see the completion status of each setup step so that I can quickly identify which configurations are complete and which still need attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the setup instructions page THEN the system SHALL display a status indicator next to each setup step
2. WHEN a setup step is properly configured THEN the system SHALL show "Completed" or equivalent positive status indicator
3. WHEN a setup step is not configured THEN the system SHALL show "Incomplete" or equivalent pending status indicator
4. WHEN I refresh the page after completing a step THEN the system SHALL update the status indicator to reflect the current state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the status indicators to be visually distinct so that I can quickly scan and identify completed vs incomplete steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing status indicators THEN completed steps SHALL use green color scheme with checkmark or similar positive visual cue
2. WHEN viewing status indicators THEN incomplete steps SHALL use red/orange color scheme with warning or similar attention-grabbing visual cue
3. WHEN viewing status indicators THEN the text SHALL be clearly readable and appropriately sized
4. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the status indicators SHALL remain visible and properly formatted

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the status detection to be accurate and reliable so that I can trust the feedback provided by the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is properly configured and accessible THEN the database step SHALL show as completed
2. WHEN mail configuration is valid (including local development setups) THEN the mail step SHALL show as completed
3. WHEN Google Drive credentials are configured THEN the Google Drive step SHALL show as completed
4. WHEN database migrations have been run successfully THEN the migration step SHALL show as completed by checking for required database tables
5. WHEN an admin user exists in the system THEN the admin user step SHALL show as completed
6. IF any configuration check fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and show incomplete status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the status indicators to update without requiring a full page reload so that I can see changes immediately after making configuration updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a "Check Status" or "Refresh Status" button THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate all step statuses via AJAX
2. WHEN status checks complete THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicators without page reload
3. WHEN status checks are in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
4. IF status check requests fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want additional context about incomplete steps so that I can understand what specifically needs to be fixed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a step shows as incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details when available
2. WHEN hovering over or clicking a status indicator THEN the system SHALL show additional context about the check performed
3. WHEN multiple issues exist for a single step THEN the system SHALL list all identified problems
4. WHEN configuration is partially complete THEN the system SHALL indicate which specific parts are missing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the queue worker setup step to provide helpful feedback about background job processing so that I can verify the system is working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recent jobs have been processed successfully THEN the queue worker step SHALL show as "Working" or similar positive status
2. WHEN there are many failed jobs or no recent job activity THEN the queue worker step SHALL show as "Needs Attention" with guidance
3. WHEN the system provides a test job feature THEN administrators SHALL be able to dispatch a test job to verify queue processing
4. WHEN queue worker status cannot be definitively determined THEN the system SHALL show "Cannot Verify - Manual Check Required" with instructions for manual verification
5. WHEN displaying queue worker status THEN the system SHALL include the timestamp of the last processed job if available

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to be able to test queue functionality from the admin dashboard at any time so that I can verify the system is working properly during ongoing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide a "Test Queue Worker" button or similar interface
2. WHEN I click the test queue button THEN the system SHALL dispatch a test job and provide real-time feedback on its processing
3. WHEN the test job completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message with processing time
4. WHEN the test job fails or times out THEN the system SHALL display error details and troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN a test is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator and prevent multiple simultaneous tests
6. WHEN viewing test results THEN the system SHALL include timestamps and job details for debugging purposes
