# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the Google Drive status messaging in the dashboard to eliminate confusing and contradictory status displays. Currently, the system shows "Healthy" status alongside "Token refresh needed" messages, which creates user confusion. The system should handle OAuth token refresh automatically and only display concerning messages when there are actual problems that require user intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see clear and consistent Google Drive status messages, so that I can understand whether my integration is working properly without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Google Drive connection is working properly and tokens can be refreshed automatically THEN the system SHALL display only "Healthy" status without additional warning messages
2. WHEN the system can successfully use the refresh token to obtain new bearer tokens THEN this SHALL be considered normal operation and not trigger warning messages
3. WHEN the Google Drive connection status is "Healthy" THEN no contradictory warning messages SHALL be displayed simultaneously
4. WHEN token refresh occurs automatically in the background THEN users SHALL not see "Token refresh needed" messages unless the refresh process fails

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the system to automatically handle OAuth token refresh without showing me technical details, so that I only see messages when my action is required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Google Drive API call requires a fresh token THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt token refresh using the stored refresh token
2. WHEN automatic token refresh succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed with the original operation without displaying refresh-related messages to the user
3. WHEN automatic token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating that reconnection is required
4. WHEN the refresh token is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL show "Connection expired - please reconnect" instead of "Token refresh needed"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see accurate status information that reflects the actual state of my Google Drive integration, so that I can take appropriate action when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Google Drive connection can successfully perform operations THEN the status SHALL be "Healthy" regardless of token age
2. WHEN the Google Drive connection cannot perform operations due to authentication issues THEN the status SHALL be "Authentication Required" with a reconnect button
3. WHEN the Google Drive connection has network or API issues THEN the status SHALL be "Connection Issues" with appropriate troubleshooting information
4. WHEN the Google Drive connection is not configured THEN the status SHALL be "Not Connected" with setup instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the "Test Connection" button to provide consistent results with the displayed status, so that I can trust the system's status reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard shows "Healthy" status THEN the "Test Connection" button SHALL succeed and confirm the healthy status
2. WHEN the "Test Connection" succeeds THEN the dashboard status SHALL not show any warning or error messages
3. WHEN the "Test Connection" fails THEN the dashboard status SHALL reflect the failure with appropriate error details
4. WHEN testing the connection triggers automatic token refresh THEN the status display SHALL update to reflect the successful refresh

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to understand what "last success" means in the context of Google Drive operations, so that I can assess the recency of successful operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying "Last success" timestamp THEN it SHALL represent the most recent successful Google Drive API operation
2. WHEN a token refresh occurs successfully THEN the "Last success" timestamp SHALL be updated
3. WHEN file uploads complete successfully THEN the "Last success" timestamp SHALL be updated
4. WHEN connection tests succeed THEN the "Last success" timestamp SHALL be updated
5. WHEN the "Last success" is recent (within 24 hours) and connection tests pass THEN no warning messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the status determination logic to be clear and consistent, so that the system provides reliable status information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining Google Drive status THEN the system SHALL prioritize actual operational capability over token age
2. WHEN a token is approaching expiration but refresh is available THEN the system SHALL attempt refresh before determining status
3. WHEN status checks are performed THEN they SHALL include actual API connectivity tests rather than just token validation
4. WHEN multiple status indicators exist THEN they SHALL be consolidated into a single, clear status message
5. WHEN status changes occur THEN the dashboard SHALL update in real-time without requiring manual refresh

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the OAuth refresh token mechanism works correctly throughout the testing process, so that the status messaging accurately reflects the system's ability to maintain Google Drive connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the Google Drive integration THEN the system SHALL verify that stored refresh tokens can successfully generate new access tokens
2. WHEN access tokens expire during testing THEN the system SHALL demonstrate automatic refresh without user intervention
3. WHEN refresh tokens are valid THEN the system SHALL complete API operations successfully and report "Healthy" status
4. WHEN refresh tokens are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully and report "Authentication Required" status
5. WHEN testing connection functionality THEN the system SHALL validate the complete OAuth flow including token refresh scenarios
