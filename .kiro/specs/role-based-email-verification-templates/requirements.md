# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement role-based email verification templates to provide customized messaging for different user types (admin, employee, client) when they receive email verification messages. Currently, all users receive the same generic verification email regardless of their role or context, which doesn't provide the most relevant messaging for their specific use case.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to receive a verification email that acknowledges my administrative role and provides context about managing the file upload system, so that I understand the purpose and scope of my access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user receives an email verification THEN the email SHALL use an admin-specific template
2. WHEN the admin verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include messaging about administrative capabilities
3. WHEN the admin verification email is sent THEN it SHALL reference system management and user oversight responsibilities
4. WHEN the admin verification email is sent THEN it SHALL use professional language appropriate for system administrators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an employee user, I want to receive a verification email that explains my role in receiving client files and managing my Google Drive integration, so that I understand how the system works for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee user receives an email verification THEN the email SHALL use an employee-specific template
2. WHEN the employee verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include messaging about receiving client uploads
3. WHEN the employee verification email is sent THEN it SHALL reference Google Drive integration and file management
4. WHEN the employee verification email is sent THEN it SHALL explain the client-employee relationship in the system
5. WHEN the employee verification email is sent THEN it SHALL use professional but approachable language

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client user, I want to receive a verification email that clearly explains how to upload files and what to expect from the process, so that I can successfully complete my file uploads without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client user receives an email verification THEN the email SHALL use a client-specific template
2. WHEN the client verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include messaging about uploading files to the company
3. WHEN the client verification email is sent THEN it SHALL explain the file upload process clearly
4. WHEN the client verification email is sent THEN it SHALL use friendly, non-technical language
5. WHEN the client verification email is sent THEN it SHALL provide reassurance about file security and delivery

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want the email verification system to automatically select the appropriate template based on the user's role or context, so that the correct messaging is sent without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an email verification is triggered THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate user role or context
2. WHEN the user role is determined THEN the system SHALL select the corresponding email template
3. WHEN no specific role can be determined THEN the system SHALL use the client template as a safe default
4. WHEN the email is sent THEN the system SHALL log which template was used for debugging purposes
5. WHEN multiple roles are possible THEN the system SHALL use the most specific role available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all email verification templates to maintain consistent branding and core functionality while allowing for role-specific messaging, so that the user experience remains cohesive across different user types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any verification email is sent THEN it SHALL use the same base email layout and styling
2. WHEN any verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include the same verification button functionality
3. WHEN any verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include the same footer and branding elements
4. WHEN any verification email is sent THEN it SHALL use the same security disclaimer text
5. WHEN any verification email is sent THEN it SHALL maintain the same technical verification URL structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the email template text to be stored in the language files so that messaging can be easily updated and potentially localized in the future, so that content management remains centralized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email templates are created THEN all user-facing text SHALL be stored in language files
2. WHEN language keys are created THEN they SHALL follow a consistent naming convention for each role
3. WHEN template content is updated THEN it SHALL only require changes to language files, not template files
4. WHEN new roles are added THEN the language file structure SHALL support easy addition of new role-specific content
5. WHEN templates are rendered THEN they SHALL properly interpolate dynamic values like company name and app name
