# Implementation Plan

> **Note**: This implementation plan has been updated to incorporate the standardized modal z-index hierarchy and debugging utilities established in the upload success modal overlay fix. See `docs/modal-z-index-standards.md` for complete modal development standards.

- [x] 1. Enhance modal state management in Alpine.js component
  - Add debugging properties to track modal state and lifecycle
  - Implement modal state recovery mechanisms
  - Add timeout-based auto-recovery for stuck modals
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Fix background overlay click event handling using standardized patterns
  - Replace direct state assignment with proper event handler method following modal component patterns
  - Implement event target checking to prevent accidental closes (event.target === event.currentTarget)
  - Add event propagation controls using established modal event handling
  - Apply backdrop click handling patterns from standardized modal component
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 1.6, 4.3_
  - _Reference: resources/views/components/modal.blade.php event handling patterns_

- [x] 3. Apply standardized modal z-index hierarchy and CSS positioning
  - Implement z-index standards: Container (z-[9999]), Content (z-[10000]), Backdrop (z-[9998])
  - Apply modal component structure following established patterns from upload success modal fix
  - Add data attributes for testing and debugging (data-modal-type, data-z-index, data-modal-name)
  - Ensure proper backdrop and panel positioning using documented standards
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.6, 2.4, 4.4_
  - _Reference: docs/modal-z-index-standards.md, resources/views/components/modal-z-index-reference.md_

- [x] 4. Integrate standardized modal debugging and error recovery tools
  - Implement debug logging following established modal debug patterns
  - Add modal debug mode support (?modal-debug=true) for file manager modals
  - Integrate with existing modal debugging utilities (resources/js/modal-debug.js)
  - Add error recovery methods for stuck modal states using documented patterns
  - Apply debug CSS classes for visual z-index debugging
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
  - _Reference: resources/css/modal-debug.css, resources/js/modal-debug.js_

- [x] 5. Enhance showConfirmation method with stability improvements
  - Add proper DOM readiness checks using Alpine.js $nextTick
  - Implement timeout clearing for existing modal operations
  - Add comprehensive state initialization
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Fix modal action confirmation and cancellation methods
  - Enhance confirmAction method with proper state cleanup
  - Improve cancelConfirmation method with complete state reset
  - Add proper function validation before execution
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 7. Test modal functionality across view modes
  - Verify delete modal works in grid view mode
  - Verify delete modal works in table view mode
  - Test view mode switching with open modals
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 8. Test bulk delete modal functionality
  - Verify bulk delete confirmation modal stability
  - Test bulk delete progress indication
  - Ensure proper bulk operation state management
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 9. Add comprehensive error handling for modal operations
  - Implement try-catch blocks around modal state changes
  - Add error logging for modal-related failures
  - Create fallback mechanisms for modal display issues
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 10. Refactor file manager modal to use standardized modal component
  - Replace custom Alpine.js modal implementation with standardized modal component
  - Migrate to x-modal component structure following established patterns
  - Ensure compatibility with existing file manager functionality
  - Apply modal naming conventions and event handling patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.6, 4.4_
  - _Reference: resources/views/components/modal.blade.php_

- [ ] 11. Validate modal implementation against z-index standards
  - Test modal layering using debug mode (?modal-debug=true)
  - Verify z-index hierarchy compliance using established testing procedures
  - Run existing modal z-index verification tests
  - Ensure no conflicts with other page elements
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.6, 2.4, 4.4_
  - _Reference: tests/Feature/ModalZIndexVerificationTest.php, tests/Feature/ModalZIndexConsistencyTest.php_

- [ ] 12. Create manual testing procedures and validation
  - Document testing steps for modal functionality using standardized debug tools
  - Create test cases for edge cases and error conditions
  - Verify all requirements are met through manual testing
  - Include z-index debugging procedures in testing documentation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_
  - _Reference: docs/modal-z-index-standards.md testing guidelines_
