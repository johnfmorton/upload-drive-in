# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The file manager delete confirmation modal has a critical usability issue where clicking the "Delete" button briefly shows the confirmation modal, but it quickly disappears and displays only a solid gray screen. This prevents users from being able to confirm or cancel file deletions, making the delete functionality completely unusable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to be able to delete files through a stable confirmation modal, so that I can manage files effectively without encountering UI blocking issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Delete" button on any file THEN the delete confirmation modal SHALL appear and remain visible until I take an action
2. WHEN the delete confirmation modal is displayed THEN I SHALL be able to see the modal content clearly without any gray overlay blocking it
3. WHEN the delete confirmation modal is open THEN I SHALL be able to click "Confirm" to proceed with deletion
4. WHEN the delete confirmation modal is open THEN I SHALL be able to click "Cancel" to close the modal without deleting
5. WHEN I click outside the modal area THEN the modal SHALL close without deleting the file
6. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN the background SHALL be properly dimmed but not completely gray/blocked

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the delete modal to work consistently across both grid and table view modes, so that I have a reliable file management experience regardless of my preferred view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in grid view mode AND I click delete THEN the confirmation modal SHALL function properly
2. WHEN I am in table view mode AND I click delete THEN the confirmation modal SHALL function properly
3. WHEN switching between view modes THEN the modal behavior SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN the modal is open in either view mode THEN the modal SHALL be properly centered and visible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the bulk delete confirmation modal to work properly, so that I can efficiently manage multiple files at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select multiple files AND click "Delete Selected" THEN the bulk delete confirmation modal SHALL appear and remain stable
2. WHEN the bulk delete modal is displayed THEN I SHALL be able to see the number of files to be deleted
3. WHEN I confirm bulk delete THEN the operation SHALL proceed with proper progress indication
4. WHEN I cancel bulk delete THEN the modal SHALL close and no files SHALL be deleted
5. WHEN bulk delete is in progress THEN the modal SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the modal implementation to be robust against common JavaScript errors and DOM manipulation issues, so that the file manager remains stable under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are JavaScript errors in other parts of the page THEN the delete modal SHALL still function properly
2. WHEN the page has been dynamically modified THEN the modal SHALL still display correctly
3. WHEN multiple modals are triggered in quick succession THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
4. WHEN the modal is opened multiple times THEN there SHALL be no duplicate overlays or z-index conflicts
5. WHEN the browser is resized while the modal is open THEN the modal SHALL remain properly positioned and visible
