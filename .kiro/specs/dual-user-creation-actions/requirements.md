# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the user management system to provide both admin and employee users with flexible client creation options. Currently, admin users can only create users without sending invitations, while employee users can only create users with automatic invitation sending. This enhancement will provide both user types with both creation methods, giving them the flexibility to choose the appropriate action based on their workflow needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to have both "Create User" and "Create & Send Invitation" options available, so that I can choose whether to immediately invite the client or create them for later invitation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user visits the users management page THEN the system SHALL display both "Create User" and "Create & Send Invitation" buttons or options
2. WHEN an admin user selects "Create User" THEN the system SHALL create a client user without sending an invitation email
3. WHEN an admin user selects "Create & Send Invitation" THEN the system SHALL create a client user and automatically send an invitation email
4. WHEN either action is completed successfully THEN the system SHALL display appropriate success feedback indicating which action was performed
5. WHEN either action fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an employee user, I want to have both "Create User" and "Create & Send Invitation" options available, so that I can choose whether to immediately invite the client or create them for later invitation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee user visits the client management page THEN the system SHALL display both "Create User" and "Create & Send Invitation" buttons or options
2. WHEN an employee user selects "Create User" THEN the system SHALL create a client user without sending an invitation email
3. WHEN an employee user selects "Create & Send Invitation" THEN the system SHALL create a client user and automatically send an invitation email
4. WHEN either action is completed successfully THEN the system SHALL display appropriate success feedback indicating which action was performed
5. WHEN either action fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the user creation functionality to maintain data consistency and security, so that all client users are properly associated with the correct company users regardless of creation method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client user is created via either method THEN the system SHALL properly associate the client with the creating user (admin or employee)
2. WHEN a client user is created via either method THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing security validations and permissions
3. WHEN a client user is created via either method THEN the system SHALL log the creation action appropriately for audit purposes
4. WHEN a client user already exists with the same email THEN the system SHALL handle the duplicate appropriately according to existing business logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user (admin or employee), I want clear visual distinction between the two creation options, so that I can easily understand the difference and select the appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the user creation interface THEN the system SHALL clearly label each button to indicate its function
2. WHEN viewing the user creation interface THEN the system SHALL provide visual cues (icons, styling) to differentiate between the two actions
3. WHEN hovering over or focusing on each button THEN the system SHALL provide helpful tooltips or descriptions explaining the action
4. WHEN the interface is displayed on mobile devices THEN both options SHALL remain clearly distinguishable and accessible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user (admin or employee), I want consistent behavior and interface patterns across both user types, so that the experience is predictable regardless of my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing admin and employee user creation interfaces THEN the system SHALL use consistent button styling, labeling, and positioning
2. WHEN comparing success/error messages between user types THEN the system SHALL use consistent messaging patterns
3. WHEN using either creation method THEN the system SHALL follow the same form validation and submission patterns
4. WHEN accessing the functionality THEN both user types SHALL have equivalent access to both creation methods
