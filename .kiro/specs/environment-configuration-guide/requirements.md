# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create comprehensive documentation to help users configure environment variables for caching, queues, and background job processing in the Laravel application. Based on validation testing, the documentation will explain working configuration options (file and database caching work, Redis requires additional setup), validate that various caching backends function correctly, and provide guidance on choosing between cron jobs and daemon processes for background file processing. The documentation will also identify unused environment variables like MEMCACHED_HOST that can be safely removed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator setting up the application, I want clear documentation about caching configuration options so that I can choose and configure the appropriate caching backend for my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL explain the purpose and configuration of CACHE_STORE and CACHE_DRIVER variables
2. WHEN caching options are documented THEN the system SHALL provide configuration examples for Redis, database, and file-based caching
3. WHEN Redis caching is documented THEN the system SHALL explain all required Redis environment variables (REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PASSWORD, REDIS_PORT, REDIS_CLIENT) and DDEV setup requirements
4. WHEN database caching is documented THEN the system SHALL explain that the cache table already exists and provide validation commands
5. WHEN file caching is documented THEN the system SHALL explain that it works out-of-the-box and provide storage location details
6. WHEN caching configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL include tested validation commands that confirm each backend works correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to understand queue configuration options so that I can set up reliable background job processing for file uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queue documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL explain the QUEUE_CONNECTION environment variable and available drivers
2. WHEN queue drivers are documented THEN the system SHALL provide configuration examples for database, Redis, and sync queues
3. WHEN Redis queue configuration is shown THEN the system SHALL explain how Redis settings apply to both caching and queues
4. WHEN queue configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL include steps to test queue functionality
5. WHEN queue setup is documented THEN the system SHALL explain the relationship between queues and the UploadToGoogleDrive job

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to understand the pros and cons of different background job processing methods so that I can choose the best approach for my server environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background job processing is documented THEN the system SHALL compare cron job versus daemon (queue worker) approaches
2. WHEN cron job approach is explained THEN the system SHALL list advantages including simplicity, automatic restart, and resource management
3. WHEN cron job approach is explained THEN the system SHALL list disadvantages including processing delays and potential job overlap
4. WHEN daemon approach is explained THEN the system SHALL list advantages including real-time processing and better performance
5. WHEN daemon approach is explained THEN the system SHALL list disadvantages including process management complexity and potential memory leaks
6. WHEN both approaches are documented THEN the system SHALL provide specific implementation commands and configuration examples

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want to validate that my chosen caching configuration works correctly so that I can be confident in my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis caching validation is performed THEN the system SHALL provide DDEV service addition steps and artisan commands to test Redis connectivity
2. WHEN database caching validation is performed THEN the system SHALL provide tested tinker commands that confirm database cache storage works
3. WHEN file caching validation is performed THEN the system SHALL provide tested tinker commands that confirm file cache operations work
4. WHEN cache validation commands are run THEN the system SHALL provide clear success or failure messages with troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and resolution steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to clean up unnecessary environment variables so that my configuration is minimal and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variable documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL identify which variables are required versus optional
2. WHEN unused variables are identified THEN the system SHALL confirm that MEMCACHED_HOST can be safely removed since memcached service is not running in the current DDEV setup (though PHP extension exists)
3. WHEN variable cleanup is documented THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on removing unused caching backend configurations
4. WHEN environment cleanup is performed THEN the system SHALL ensure no functionality is broken by variable removal
5. WHEN final configuration is documented THEN the system SHALL provide a minimal working example for each supported caching backend

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want production-ready configuration recommendations so that I can deploy the application with optimal performance and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN production configuration is documented THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal caching backends for different deployment scenarios
2. WHEN production queue setup is documented THEN the system SHALL provide supervisor configuration examples for queue workers
3. WHEN production recommendations are given THEN the system SHALL explain monitoring and maintenance requirements for each approach
4. WHEN performance considerations are documented THEN the system SHALL explain the impact of different configurations on file upload processing
5. WHEN production setup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide health check commands to verify all components are working correctly
