# Token Refresh Security Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security measures implemented for token refresh operations in the Google Drive token auto-renewal system.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Rate Limiting for Token Refresh Attempts

**User-based Rate Limiting:**
- Maximum 5 attempts per hour per user
- Implemented in `TokenSecurityService::checkUserRateLimit()`
- Cache key: `token_refresh_rate_limit_user_{user_id}`
- TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

**IP-based Rate Limiting:**
- Maximum 20 attempts per hour per IP address
- Implemented in `TokenSecurityService::checkIpRateLimit()`
- Cache key: `token_refresh_ip_rate_limit_ip_{ip_address}`
- TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

**Middleware Implementation:**
- `TokenRefreshRateLimit` middleware applied to critical routes
- Returns 429 status code when rate limits are exceeded
- Includes rate limit headers in responses:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum attempts allowed
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining attempts
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Timestamp when limit resets

### 2. Security Logging for Authentication Operations

**Structured Security Logging:**
- Dedicated security log channel: `storage/logs/security-{date}.log`
- All token refresh operations logged with operation IDs
- Comprehensive context including IP address, user agent, timestamps

**Logged Events:**
- `rate_limit_exceeded`: User rate limit violations
- `ip_rate_limit_exceeded`: IP rate limit violations
- `token_refresh_failure`: Failed token refresh attempts
- `token_rotated`: Successful token rotations
- `user_intervention`: Manual user actions
- `authentication_event`: General authentication events

**Log Structure:**
```json
{
  "event": "token_refresh_failure",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T10:30:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "user_id": 123,
    "error_message": "Invalid refresh token",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "context": {...}
  }
}
```

### 3. Token Rotation on Successful Refresh

**Security Enhancement:**
- Automatic token rotation implemented in `TokenSecurityService::rotateTokenOnRefresh()`
- Updates both access and refresh tokens when available
- Resets failure counters on successful refresh
- Logs token rotation events for audit trail

**Implementation Details:**
- Called from `GoogleDriveService::refreshToken()`
- Integrated with `TokenRefreshCoordinator` for thread-safe operations
- Maintains token history for security analysis

### 4. Audit Trail for Token Refresh Failures and User Interventions

**Failure Auditing:**
- `TokenSecurityService::auditRefreshFailure()` logs all failures
- Includes exception details, stack traces, and context
- Categorizes errors by type for analysis

**User Intervention Auditing:**
- `TokenSecurityService::auditUserIntervention()` logs manual actions
- Tracks reconnection attempts, manual token refreshes
- Records user context and reasoning

**Audit Data Retention:**
- Security logs retained for 90 days
- Structured format for automated analysis
- Includes correlation IDs for tracking related events

### 5. Protected Routes with Rate Limiting

**Admin Routes:**
- `/admin/cloud-storage/reconnect`
- `/admin/cloud-storage/test`
- `/admin/cloud-storage/google-drive/connect`
- `/admin/cloud-storage/google-drive/callback`
- `/admin/cloud-storage/google-drive/folders/*`
- `/admin/dashboard/cloud-storage/{provider}/health-check`

**Employee Routes:**
- `/employee/{username}/cloud-storage/*`
- `/employee/{username}/google-drive/*`

**Middleware Application:**
- `token.refresh.rate.limit` middleware applied to all critical endpoints
- Coordinated with existing authentication and authorization middleware
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 6. Security Analysis Tools

**Console Command:**
- `php artisan security:analyze-logs` for log analysis
- Filters by date range, event type, user, or IP address
- Generates security alerts for suspicious patterns
- Provides hourly distribution analysis

**Analysis Features:**
- Event type breakdown and statistics
- Top users and IP addresses by event count
- Automated security alerts for:
  - Users with >20 security events (potential abuse)
  - IPs with >50 security events (potential attack)
  - High rate limit violation rates
  - Excessive authentication failure rates

## Integration Points

### 1. TokenRefreshCoordinator Integration
- Rate limiting checks performed before token refresh attempts
- Audit logging integrated into refresh coordination
- Thread-safe operations with proper error handling

### 2. GoogleDriveService Integration
- Security service injected for token operations
- Automatic token rotation on successful refresh
- Comprehensive logging of all token operations

### 3. Real-time Health Validation
- Security checks integrated with health status validation
- Rate limiting applied to health check endpoints
- Audit trail for health validation failures

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- `TokenSecurityServiceTest`: Comprehensive service testing
- `TokenRefreshRateLimitTest`: Middleware testing
- All rate limiting, logging, and audit functionality covered

### Feature Tests
- `TokenRefreshSecurityTest`: End-to-end security testing
- Integration with actual token refresh flows
- Rate limiting behavior verification

### Security Tests
- Concurrent request handling
- Rate limit enforcement
- Audit logging verification
- Token rotation security

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Rate limits configurable via service constants
- Log retention periods configurable in `config/logging.php`
- Cache TTL settings in service configuration

### Security Settings
- User rate limit: 5 attempts/hour (configurable)
- IP rate limit: 20 attempts/hour (configurable)
- Log retention: 90 days for security logs
- Cache backend: Redis for distributed rate limiting

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Token refresh success/failure rates
- Rate limit violation frequency
- User intervention frequency
- IP-based attack patterns

### Alert Thresholds
- >10% token refresh failure rate
- >50 security events per IP per hour
- >20 security events per user per day
- Consistent rate limit violations

### Log Analysis
- Automated daily analysis via scheduled command
- Security event correlation and pattern detection
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of rate limiting (user + IP)
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: All security events logged with context
3. **Token Rotation**: Regular token refresh for improved security
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of security-related actions
5. **Automated Analysis**: Proactive threat detection and alerting
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Proper error handling and user feedback

## Compliance and Standards

- Follows OWASP security guidelines for API protection
- Implements proper rate limiting as per RFC 6585
- Structured logging for compliance and forensic analysis
- Audit trail meets security compliance requirements
