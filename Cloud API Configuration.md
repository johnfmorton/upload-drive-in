### How to get Microsoft OneDrive API Key

You need to create a new application in the Azure portal. Yes, if you don't have an Azure account, you need to create one. It's free although the markeing language is a bit confusing. You may see some offers that you don't want that sound like a trap. For example, when I signed up, I got offered 12 months of free access to Azure. I simply wanted an API key for OneDrive, but this is the process Microsoft requires you to go through.

The serverices we will use are free, but the Azure account creation process requires a credit card.

### The process

1. Go to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations" > "New registration".
3. Fill in the required fields and create the application.
4. Once the application is created, you will be redirected to the application's page.
5. Copy the "Application (client) ID" and save it for later use.
